However, those LDPC codes of ﬁnite length are prone to suffer from high error ﬂoors [2] in low error rate region. The error ﬂoor phenomenon is closely re- lated to minimum Hamming distance and some combinatorial structures such as stopping sets [3] and trapping sets [2]. In designing LDPC codes for low error ﬂoors, small minimum Hamming distance and small-size stopping sets or trapping sets should be avoided. Most well-known irregular LDPC codes have many degree-2 variable nodes [1], [4], [5] but it is known that the minimum Hamming distance of a ﬁnite- length irregular LDPC code tends to get smaller as it has more degree-2 variable nodes [6], [7].\nRecently, irregular quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC codes with the block dual-diagonal (BDD) parity structure are widely adopted in many standards such as IEEE 802.16e [4] and 802.11n [5] because the BDD structure enables the efﬁcient encoding [8], [9] and leads to good error-correcting performance especially in waterfall region. The BDD structure consists of mostly degree-2 variable nodes and therefore, if the rate of QC LDPC codes with the BDD structure is given, the fraction of degree-2 variable nodes in the parity-check matrices cannot be below a certain value. This restriction may prevent QC LDPC codes from having good degree distributions. Especially, low- rate QC LDPC codes with the BDD structure have so many degree-2 variable nodes that they cannot have large minimum\nHamming distance for ﬁnite-length case and good threshold for asymptotic case [1].\nIn this paper, a new BDD structure is proposed for irregular QC LDPC codes to lower error ﬂoors. By adopting multi- weight circulants, the parity part of parity-check matrices can have ﬂexible degree distribution while maintaining BDD structure and supporting the efﬁcient encoding. Therefore, by properly adjusting the fraction of degree-2 variable nodes, QC LDPC codes can have large minimum Hamming distance and good threshold. The proposed BDD structure improves the error-correcting performance, especially, in the case of low- rate QC LDPC codes. QC LDPC codes with the proposed BDD structure which do not include harmful stopping sets or trapping sets are generated and it is shown via numerical analysis that they have lower error ﬂoor than QC LDPC codes with the conventional BDD structure.\nLet C be a binary QC LDPC code whose parity-check matrix H is a J × L array of z × z circulants or zero matrices as\n⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣\n⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦\nwhere a circulant H j,l is deﬁned as a matrix whose each row is a cyclic shift of the row above it. Let M × N be the size of H. Then M = Jz, N = Lz, and the code design rate R = 1 − M/N = 1 − J/L. The Tanner graph of C is a bipartite graph which has H as its incidence matrix.\nThe weight of a circulant H j,l is deﬁned as the number of nonzero elements in the ﬁrst column and denoted by wt( H j,l ). A circulant of weight 1 is called circulant permutation matrix. A multi-weight circulant is deﬁned as a circulant of weight larger than 1. A circulant is entirely described by the positions of nonzero elements in the ﬁrst column. Let the index of the i- th element in the ﬁrst column be i−1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ z. The shift value(s) of a circulant is deﬁned as the index (indices) of the nonzero element(s) in the ﬁrst column. Note that a shift value\n⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣\n2 1 0 0 · · · 0 0 0 0 2 1 0 · · · 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 · · · 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 · · · 0 0 0 .. . .. . .. . .. . . .. ... ... ...\n0 0 0 0 · · · 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 · · · 0 2 1 1 0 0 0 · · · 0 0 1\n⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦\n⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣\n⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦\ntakes the value from 0 to z − 1 and a multi-weight circulant has multiple shift values.\nQC LDPC codes can be fully represented by binary poly- nomials as shown in [10]. This polynomial representation is based on the isomorphism between z ×z binary circulants and the polynomial ring F 2 [ x]/(x z + 1). The polynomial parity- check matrix H(x) of C is deﬁned as\n⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣\nh 0,0 ( x) h 0,1 ( x) · · · h 0,L−1 ( x) h 1,0 ( x) h 1,1 ( x) · · · h 1,L−1 ( x)\n⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦\nwhere h j,l ( x) = z−1 i=0 h j,l,i x i ∈ F 2 [ x]/(x z + 1) and h j,l,i is the element with the index i in the ﬁrst column of H j,l . We can see that the number of terms in h j,l ( x) is equal to wt(H j,l ) and the degrees of all terms in h j,l ( x) are equivalent to the shift values of H j,l .\nQC LDPC codes are also described as protograph-based LDPC codes [11] because they can be regarded as the lifted ones from the protographs using cyclic permutations. The incidence matrix of the protograph P of C is represented as P = [p j,l ], where p j,l = wt( H j,l ). By abuse of notation, P will represent the bipartite graph itself or its incidence matrix based on their equivalence. Let z be called the lift size of C. A multi-weight circulant H j,l is represented as parallel edges between the horizontal node j and the vertical node l in the protograph and each edge in the protograph has a shift value so that the edge is lifted by using the cyclic permutation with the shift value to generate C.\nFor convenience, each matrix is divided into the mes- sage part and the parity part: H = [ H m | H p ], H(x) = [ H m ( x) | H p ( x) ], and P = [ P m | P p ]. Note that the size of H m and H p is M × (N − M) and M × M, respectively, and the size of H m ( x) and P m is J × (L − J) and the size of H p ( x) and P p is J × J. Accordingly, a codeword of C is split into the message part m and the parity part p.\nWe propose a new BDD structure for the parity part of the parity-check matrix, which has the forms in the protograph and the polynomial parity-check matrix as in the top of this page.\nIn the proposed P p , 2\u2019s are located only at diagonal posi- tions. Let n 2 , 1 ≤ n 2 ≤ J, be the number of 2\u2019s in P p . Clearly,\nn 2 equals to the number of weight-2 circulants in H p or the number of binomials in H p ( x). Since n 2 is not a ﬁxed number, it is usually determined by the desired degree distribution. In each weight-2 circulant, one has zero shift value and the other has a nonzero shift value from {1, 2, . . . , z −1}. Let r i and s i , i = 1, 2, . . . , n 2 , denote the row index (equal to the column index) and the nonzero shift value of the i-th binomial in H p ( x), respectively. Note that 0 ≤ r i ≤ J −1, 1 ≤ s i ≤ z−1, and r 1 < r 2 < · · · < r n 2 . Deﬁne S as the multiset of all nonzero shift values in H p , that is, S = {s i |i = 1, . . . , n 2 }. Note that an element is allowed to appear more than once in a multiset.\nUnlike the conventional BDD structure, the proposed BDD structure provides the ﬂexibility in controlling the fraction of degree-2 and degree-3 variable nodes by adjusting n 2 . Note that for given J and z, the fraction of degree-2 variable nodes for the rate- R QC LDPC codes with the proposed BDD structure is (1 − R)(1 − n 2 /J) if H m does not have degree-2 variable nodes. Even though R is small, the fraction of degree-2 variable nodes can be decreased by increasing n 2 . Thus QC LDPC codes with the proposed BDD structure have more ﬂexibility in taking any good degree distribution, which is a desirable property for the irregular QC LDPC codes because good irregular QC LDPC codes generally have many degree-3 variable nodes as well as degree-2 variable nodes as seen in optimal degree distributions [1] and many standards [4], [5], [12]. Also, QC LDPC codes with the proposed BDD structure can have larger minimum Hamming distance and better threshold than those with the conventional BDD structure.\nThe proposed BDD structure can provide the efﬁcient encoding by properly determining the nonzero shift values of weight-2 circulants. Assume that n 2 is already determined according to the desired degree distribution, and J and z are also given. S is ﬁrstly determined for the efﬁcient encoding in this section and then r i , i = 1, . . . , n 2 and the ordering of the elements in S are also determined in Section IV.\nRecall the efﬁcient encoding of LDPC codes in [8]. A parity-check matrix H can be partitioned into\n⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣\n⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦\nwhere B, T, D, and E form the parity part, T is a lower- triangular matrix, and D is a square matrix. Denote the parity part of a codeword by p = [ p 1 p 2 ], where p 1 corresponds to B and D and p 2 corresponds to T and E. Then, p 1 and p 2 are obtained as\np T 1 = φ −1 ( ET −1 A + C)m T p T 2 = T −1 ( Am T + Bp T 1 )\nNow, consider the efﬁcient encoding of QC LDPC codes with the proposed BDD structure. First, assume that n 2 = J, which means every diagonal element in P p is 2. The case of other value of n 2 can be treated similarly as this case. Let H(x) be represented by a partitioned polynomial parity-check matrix as\nFrom the deﬁnition of the proposed BDD structure, we have B(x) = 1 + x s 1 0 · · · 0 T , D(x) = 1 , E(x) =\n⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣\n1 \t 0 \t 0 · · · \t 0 \t 0 1 + x s 2 \t 1 \t 0 · · · \t 0 \t 0\n0 \t 1 + x s 3 1 · · · \t 0 \t 0 .. . \t .. . .. . . .. \t .. . \t .. .\n⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦\nWe can easily derive the inverse of T(x) as in the top of this page. Finally, φ(x) is derived as\nTherefore, φ is a z×z circulant of weight equal to the number of terms in φ(x).\nFor the efﬁcient encoding, the existence of φ −1 should be guaranteed. A simple way for this is making φ be a circulant permutation matrix, that is, φ(x) = x k for some 0 ≤ k ≤ z − 1, by ﬁnding proper s i , i = 1, 2, . . . , J. Then we have φ −1 ( x) = x −k mod z and p 1 and p 2 can be efﬁciently encoded. We can ﬁnd such a S from Theorems 1 and 2 whose proofs are omitted in this paper. Note that when z is even, s i should not be z/2 to avoid cycles of length 4 inside the i-th weight-2 circulant of H p [10].\nTheorem 1: Assume that z = 2 k for all integers k < J. Then S = {2 0 mod z, 2 0 mod z, 2 1 mod z, 2 2\nmod z, . . . , 2 J−2 mod z} yields φ(x) = x 2 J−1 mod z and guarantees that cycles of length 4 do not occur in each weight- 2 circulant.\nTheorem 2: Assume that z = 2 l for some integer log 2 J + 1 ≤ l ≤ J − 1. Then, there exist s i , i = 1, . . . , J, which generate φ(x) = x 2 l−1 and avoid cycles of length 4 in each weight-2 circulant.\nFrom Theorems 1 and 2, we can clearly determine S supporting the efﬁcient encoding and avoid cycles of length 4 in each weight-2 circulant for n 2 = J and almost all z. Note that Theorems 1 and 2 hold regardless of r i , i = 1, . . . , J and in addition, it is not necessary to know every s i . For the efﬁcient encoding, it is only required to determine the multiset S from which each s i will be taken in Section IV.\nIn the case of n 2 < J, we can similarly have φ(x) = (1 + x s 1 )(1 + x s 2 ) · · · (1 + x s n2 ) + 1 regardless of r i , i = 1, . . . , n 2 . Hence, {2 0 mod z, 2 0 mod z, 2 1 mod z, 2 2 mod z, . . . , 2 n 2 −2 mod z} or the splitted version of {2 0 , 2 0 , 2 1 , 2 2 , . . . , 2 l−2 } for an integer l < n 2 as in Theorems 1 and 2 can be used as S to support the efﬁcient encoding and avoid cycles of length 4.\nIt is experimentally shown in [9] that the girth of the subgraph consisting of only variable nodes of low degree (i.e., degrees 2 and 3) in H is desired to be large for good error-correcting performance in the error ﬂoor region. This observation agrees with the concept of the approximate cycle extrinsic message degree (ACE) algorithm [13] that are used to avoid harmful stopping sets and trapping sets. Accordingly, for the given S in Theorem 1 or 2, we aim to ﬁnd r i , i = 1, . . . , n 2 and the ordering of the elements in S for sufﬁciently large girth of H p .\nThe girth of a QC LDPC code is clearly determined by the structure of the protograph, lift size, and all shift values assigned to edges. However, we can derive an upper bound on the girth of QC LDPC codes lifted from a given protograph without considering the lift size and shift values based on the concept of inevitable cycles.\nDeﬁnition 1 ([14], [15]): An inevitable cycle induced by a protograph is deﬁned as the shortest one of the cycles which should appear in the QC LDPC codes lifted from the protograph regardless of the lift size and shift values.\nThe protograph of the proposed BDD structure is relatively simple as shown in Fig. 1.\nDeﬁnition 2 ([16]): A ( x 1 , x 2 ; y)-dumbbell graph, denoted by D(x 1 , x 2 ; y), is a connected graph consisting of two edge- disjoint cycles X 1 and X 2 of the numbers of edges x 1 ≥ 1 and x 2 ≥ 1, respectively, that are connected by a path Y of the number of edges y ≥ 0.\nLemma 1 ([16]): D(x 1 , x 2 ; y) induces the inevitable cycles of length 2( x 1 + x 2 ) + 4 y.\nIn the protograph of the proposed BDD structure, we can ﬁnd n 2 dumbbell graphs connected back to back to form a chain. Let y i , i = 1, . . . , n 2 − 1, denote the number of 1\u2019s along with the shortest path between the i-th and (i + 1)-th 2\u2019s in P p and y n 2 denote the one between n 2 -th and the ﬁrst 2\u2019s. Then, we have y i = 2( r i+1 −r i ) −1 for i = 1, . . . , n 2 −1 and y n 2 = 2( J + r 1 − r n 2 ) − 1. The length of the inevitable cycles induced by P p can be obtained in the next theorem.\nTheorem 3: The length of the inevitable cycles induced by P p is min i:1≤i≤n 2 {8 + 4y i }.\nProof: In P p , there are n 2 dumbbell graphs, that is, D(2, 2; y i ) for i = 1, . . . , n 2 . Based on the Deﬁnition 1, the inevitable cycles induced by P p are determined only by D(2, 2; y i ) with the smallest y i . From Lemma 1, the length of the inevitable cycles is min i:1≤i≤n 2 {8 + 4y i }.\nAccording to Theorem 3, y i \u2019s, i = 1, . . . , n 2 , are desired to have as close values as possible for avoiding short inevitable cycles in H p . Although the length of the inevitable cycles induced by P p is an upper bound on the girth of H p , not the girth itself, these y i \u2019s are adequate for achieving sufﬁciently large girth. In addition, since a cycle in H p is generated by a walk traversing two or more double edges in P p [15], a small y i is more likely to generate short cycles. For y i \u2019s determined as equally as possible, the ordering of the elements\nin S which maximizes the girth of H p can be obtained via extensive search. This full search is a time-consuming job but for moderate n 2 , it is generally manageable because n 2 is not large in most cases.\nFor given J, L, z, H p , and degree distributions in H, H m should be carefully constructed for QC LDPC codes to have low error ﬂoors. For this, the submatrix of H consisting of the columns of low weight should have a sufﬁciently large girth [9], [13] and thus the construction algorithm in [9], which will be called the stepwise greedy girth-maximizing (SGGM) algorithm in this paper, is used for constructing H m . It is assumed that H m only consists of circulant permutation matrices and zero matrices and its column weights are larger than or equal to 3.\nTo verify the effectiveness of the proposed BDD structure, the error-correcting performance of QC LDPC codes with the proposed BDD structure is compared with that with the conventional BDD structure. All simulations are performed using the belief propagation (BP) decoding under the binary AWGN channel and the maximum number of iterations is set to 100.\nFour QC LDPC codes with J = 30, L = 45, and z = 45 are generated. The ﬁrst one, denoted by \u2018Prop1,\u2019 has the proposed BDD structure as the parity part and its message part is constructed from the SGGM algorithm. The second one, denoted by \u2018Conv1,\u2019 has the conventional BDD structure as the parity part and its message part is also constructed from the SGGM algorithm. The third one, denoted by \u2018Prop2,\u2019 has the proposed BDD structure as the parity part and is selected among 200 QC LDPC codes with sufﬁciently large girth whose parity-check matrices have the message parts randomly lifted from a randomly constructed protograph. The last one, denoted by \u2018Conv2,\u2019 is the counterpart to \u2018Prop2.\u2019 These codes have the parameters N = 2025 and R = 1/3 and it is noted that the rate-1 /3 QC LDPC codes in ETSI DVB-S2 standards [12] also have 30 × 45 protographs.\nThe degree distributions of four QC LDPC codes are shown in Table I. \u2018Conv1\u2019 and \u2018Conv2\u2019 has almost the same degree distribution as the rate-1 /3 QC LDPC codes in ETSI DVB-S2 standards. We can see that there are too many variable nodes of degree 2 in \u2018Conv1\u2019 and \u2018Conv2\u2019 due to the conventional BDD structure. These QC LDPC codes have 1 .004 as the\nthreshold under the AWGN channel which is calculated from [17]. Note that the girths of \u2018Conv1\u2019 and \u2018Conv2\u2019 are 8 and 6, respectively.\nThe degree distribution in Table I is used for the proposed BDD cases \u2018Prop1\u2019 and \u2018Prop2\u2019 with n 2 = 9. For fair comparison, the number of edges in the parity-check matrices of \u2018Prop1\u2019 and \u2018Prop2\u2019 is not larger than that of \u2018Conv1\u2019 and \u2018Conv2.\u2019 The threshold of these QC LDPC codes is 1 .225 which is much larger than that of \u2018Conv1\u2019 and \u2018Conv2.\u2019 Note that the girths of \u2018Prop1\u2019 and \u2018Prop2\u2019 are 8 and 6, respectively.\nThe frame error rate (FER) and bit error rate (BER) of the above four QC LDPC codes are shown in Fig. 2. In both FER and BER, \u2018Prop1\u2019 and \u2018Prop2\u2019 show better error- correcting performance than \u2018Conv1\u2019 and \u2018Conv2\u2019 in the error ﬂoor region, respectively.\nIn this paper, a new BDD structure is proposed for irregular QC LDPC codes to achieve low error ﬂoors. By adopting weight-2 circulants, the parity part of parity-check matrices can have ﬂexible degree distribution, which can results in large minimum Hamming distance unlike the case of the conven- tional BDD structure. The proposed BDD structure can support the efﬁcient encoding of QC LDPC codes by determining the set of shift values appropriately. We search for good QC LDPC codes with the proposed BDD structure by determining the ordering of nonzero shift values in the proposed BDD structure and properly locating weight-2 circulants. It is shown via numerical analysis that QC LDPC codes with the proposed BDD structure have good error-correcting performance in the error ﬂoor region compared to those with the conventional BDD structure.\nThis work was supported by the National Research Foun- dation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea govern- ment (MEST) (No.2012-0000186) and also supported by the\nKCC (Korea Communications Commission) under the R&D program supervised by the KCA (Korea Communications Agency) (KCA-2012-08-911-04-003)."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"T.
