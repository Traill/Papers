Recent studies suggest that many of these channels are affected by additive noise that is best explained by alpha-stable statistics.\nWe study in this work such channel models and we characterize the capacity-achieving input distribution for those channels under fractional order moment constraints. We prove that the optimal input is necessarily discrete with a compact support for all such channels.\nInterestingly, if the second moment is viewed as a measure of power, even when the channel input is allowed to have inﬁnite second moment, the optimal one is found to have ﬁnite power."},"body":{"text":"as the authors know, only numerical evaluation of some achievable rates have been conducted [4], [5]. In this work, we attempt to partially answer these questions.\nEarlier information theoretic studies of linear channels un- der general additive non-Gaussian noise have been conducted as in [6], [7]. However, typically these studies either require a ﬁnite noise variance which is not the case in this model, or impose a peak input power condition, a constraint that we will not impose in this work. It is worth noting as well that, it is not clear whether the S αS noise model ﬁts within the general categories described in [7].\nIn this paper, we study the additive linear channel model, where a S αS noise variable is added to the input that is generally constrained to satisfy a fractional r-th order moment constraint: E [ |X| r ] ≤ a, for any real value of r > 1. Clearly, the average power constrained channel is a special case of our setup. More importantly, if r is chosen to be less than 2, then the input is technically allowed to have inﬁnite power similarly to the noise and the received signal: a primary motivation behind this particular choice of the input constraint. Since the received signal is of inﬁnite power, and if a transceiver\u2019s hardware is capable of coping with such a received signal, then it should be able to cope with a similar transmitted one.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: We ﬁrst describe the channel model in Section II and derive a lower bound on the output PDF in Section III. Our main results are presented in Section IV, and Section V concludes the paper. Two Appendices I and II establish useful technical lemmas.\nWe consider the real linear discrete-time memoryless chan- nel:\nwhere Y is the channel output and X is its input which is subject to the fractional r-th order moment constraint: E [ |X| r ] ≤ a for some real-valued r > 1 and a > 0. The additive noise variable N , which is independent of the input, is assumed to behave statistically as an alpha-stable Random Variable (RV) whose characteristic function is deﬁned by:\nwhere α ∈ [1, 2), c > 0 and γ ∈ R. We note ﬁrst that, from an information theoretic perspective, assuming the values γ = 0 and c = 1, does not affect the generality of the problem since\n  \nthe bound in the two ranges follow similar steps. We present them hereafter for y ≤ −y 0 :\nwhere we used the lower bound in (2) to obtain (4), and (5) is justiﬁed by the fact that g(y − x) is a decreasing function of x on the given interval. The last inequality is an application of Markov\u2019s inequality and the r-th moment constraint.\nIn the following we state and prove the main theorem of this paper\nTheorem. The capacity achieving input of channel (1), when- ever r > 1 and α ∈ [1, 2) is compactly supported, discrete with no accumulation point except possibly at zero.\nProof: With the sufﬁcient topological and functional requirements satisﬁed, we proceed as in [8] and we write the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions as being necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for the unique optimal input to satisfy. These conditions state that an input random variable X ∗ with Cumulative Distribution Function F ∗ achieves the capacity C of an r-th moment constrained channel if and only if there exists ν ≥ 0 such that,\nfor all x ∈ R, with equality if x is a point of increase of F ∗ . H is the entropy of the noise and is ﬁnite by virtue of equation (2) along with the continuity of p N (·). Assume that the points of increase of F ∗ have a positive accumulation point and let\nThe function s(z) is analytic on S δ \\R − by virtue of Lemma 2 proven in Appendix II and by using for z r the principal branch of the logarithm [11, p.85 Prop.1.6.4]. Since s(z) has accumulating zeros on the positive real axis, by the identity theorem [12], s(·) is identically null on S δ \\ R − . Therefore,\np N (y) ln p(y − x; F ∗ ) dy = I 1 + I 2 + I 3\np N (y) ln p(y − x; F ∗ ) dy ≤ − (ln k α ) [1 − Pr(N > x − y 0 )] +\nHowever, LHS (x i ) = 0 for all points of increase x i . If these were arbitrarily large, then ν will be zero which is not possible.\nWe studied the channel capacity and the capacity-achieving input distributions for channels affected by S αS additive noise.\nWe proved that the optimal input is discrete and compactly supported for any fractional order input moment constraint larger than one. We note that, even when imposing a fractional lower order moment constraint on the input and allowing it to be potentially of inﬁnite variance, since the optimal input is compactly supported, its variance is nevertheless ﬁnite. This indicates that over these types of channels, surprisingly, it does not increase the rates to transmit with inﬁnite power. We acknowledge that measuring the power of a signal via the second moment might not be adequate in this context.\nWe also note that the methodology developed in this paper may be readily used for Pareto distributions.\nFinally, the results may be readily generalized for non-linear channels of the form Y = sgn(X)|X| s + N , where N is a S αS noise random variable, and where the input is subject to E [ |X| t ] ≤ a, t > s. An appropriate change of variable as in [14] yields readily a similar result.\nWe study in this appendix the rate of decay of standard S αS distributions with α ∈ [1, 2) on the horizontal strip S = {z ∈ C : |ℑ(z)| < 1}. We prove that |p N (z)| = O \t 1 |ℜ(z)| α +1 , for z ∈ S as |ℜ(z)| → ∞ \u2021 .\nFor the case α = 1, p N (z) = 1 π 1 1+z 2 which clearly satisﬁes our assertion. When α > 1, p N (·) can be formally extended on C as:\nwhere we wrote z = x + iy, and used Lebesgue\u2019s Dominated Convergence Theorem (DCT) for the interchange in (9). This is justiﬁed since\nWe study next J n (x) ˆ = ∞ −∞ t n e ixt −|t| α dt \u2020\u2020 . It is known that lim x →∞ x α +1 J 0 (x) = 2 Γ(α + 1) sin πα 2 [15, p.134].\n- 6\nwhere the interchange is valid because Re −R γ sin(γφ) is de- creasing as 0 < γθ ≤ γφ ≤ π 2 . Hence, lim R →∞ C 1 f (z) = 0. Similarly, it can be shown that lim ρ →0 C 2 f (z) = 0. It remains to evaluate the integral on L 2 where z = te i π 2γ ,\nIn conclusion lim x →∞ I n = e i π 2 (n+α) Γ(n + α), and by (11), we can write for n ≥ 1\nSince lim x α +1 J 0 (x) exists and is equal to U 0 = 2 Γ(α + 1) sin( πα 2 ), then U n ˆ = lim\nx n +α+1 J n (x) exists for all non-negative n and is equal to, U n = inU n −1 + W n = n! i n U 0 + n −1 k =0 i k (n−k)! W n −k . Furthermore, for n ≥ 0,\nThe last inequality is justiﬁed using the fact that for α ∈ (1, 2), Γ(α + l) is increasing for l ∈ N ∗ .\nNow using (9), lim\nwhich is ﬁnite because |y| < 1, and where we used the fact that f (x) = |x| is continuous. The interchange in (15) is valid because the end result is ﬁnite. In conclusion,\nLemma 2. The function i(·; F ) : S δ → C deﬁned by: z → i(z; F ) = − ∞\nSimilarly, for y ≥ (n 0 + |ℜ(z 0 )| + ρ) ≥ (n 0 + ℜ(z 0 ) + ρ), p N (y − z) ≤ \t κ |y − ℜ(z\n       \n      \ny ≤ −ψ −M ln M 1 \t |y| < ψ\nψ = max n 0 + |ℜ(z 0 )| + ρ, n 0 + (2a) 1 r M = max\nNote that M is ﬁnite since the maximization of p N (·) is taken over a compact set that is included in S δ where it is analytic, and 0 < M 1 < 1 since p y (·) is positive and continuous. The fact that r(y) is integrable concludes the proof of continuity of i(z; F ).\nb) To continue the proof of analyticity, we need to integrate i(·; F ) on the boundary ∂∆ of a compact triangle ∆ ⊂ S δ . We denote by |∆| its perimeter, η 0 = min z ∈∂∆ ℜ(z), η 1 = max z ∈∂∆ ℜ(z) and φ = max{n 0 + max{|η 0 |, |η 1 |}, n 0 + (2a) 1 r }. By similar arguments as above and using the fact that p N (·) is analytic on S δ one can prove that ∂ ∆ i(z; F )dz = 0, which in addition to the continuity of i(·; F ) insure its analyticity on S δ by applying Morera\u2019s theorem.\nThe authors would like to thank AUB Professor Farouk Abi-Khuzam for helpful discussions on upper-bounding the analytic extension of the alpha-stable density function."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"M.
