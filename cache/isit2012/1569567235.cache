The model may for instance be used to describe the occurrence of catastrophic events such as earthquakes, ﬂoods, or hurricanes in certain regions; it may therefore be relevant for, e.g., weather forecasting, urban planning, and environmental assessment. The model is derived from the following ideas: The above-threshold values at each location are assumed to follow a generalized Pareto (GP) distribution.

The models may serve as quantitative tools to assess the risks associated with certain infrastructures and facilities exposed to extreme conditions.\nExtreme value theory provides a solid basis for analyzing extreme events [1]. The Pickands-Balkema-de Haan (PBdH) theorem, often called the second theorem in extreme value theory [4], states that for a large class of unknown underlying distribution functions F of a random variable X , the condi- tional excess distribution F u , for a large threshold u, is well approximated by the generalized Pareto (GP) distribution.\nThe characteristics (e.g., GP parameters) of extreme events often vary systematically with a number of covariates. For example, the characteristics of extreme waves in hurricane dominated areas vary systematically with location, time, and storm direction [5], [6]. Those covariates need to be incorpo- rated in extreme value models. In this paper, we propose to use graphical models to capture spatial covariate effects.\nSo far, spatial extreme models have only received limited attention. It is common practice to locally ﬁt the GP pa- rameters, without exploiting the spatial dependency, leading to inaccurate characterization of the extreme events. In the following, we brieﬂy review the literature on spatial extreme models. In [2] a procedure is proposed to compute the pairwise spatial dependence of extreme events, i.e., the probability of threshold exceedance at one site conditioned on exceedance at one other site [3]. Alternatively, Naveau et al. [7] quantify pairwise spatial dependence through the concept of variogram. Both studies are limited to pairwise dependency. Recently, Northrop et al. [6] proposed a parametric model where the\nGP parameters depend on the location. The thresholds are determined through quantile regression, using Legendre poly- nomials. Our proposed model is similar in spirit, but is based on graphical models instead of polynomial regression.\nIn the model proposed here, the threshold exceedance at each location is modeled by the GP distribution. Thin- membrane models characterize the variation of the GP pa- rameters across space. We then follow an empirical Bayes approach, inferring the smoothness parameters of the thin- membrane models using expectation maximization (EM).\nNumerical results for synthetic and real data (related to hur- ricanes in the Gulf of Mexico) show that the proposed spatial extreme model can indeed capture spatial variations in the characteristics of extreme events. By inferring the smoothness parameters of the thin-membrane model, the smoothness is adjusted automatically in a suitable manner. In some numerical examples, the MRF-GP model yields location-independent GP shape and scale parameters, while the GP threshold is location dependent. Spatial variations in the characteristics of extreme events are then fully captured by only varying the threshold in space, resulting in a model with signiﬁcantly fewer parameters.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we brieﬂy review the GP distribution and thin-membrane model, which are the main components of the proposed model. The model itself is explained in detail in Section III. Numerical results on synthetic and real datasets are brieﬂy presented in Section IV. We offer concluding remarks in Section V.\nIn this section, we give a short description of the generalized Pareto (GP) distribution and the thin-membrane model.\nWe consider a random variable X with unknown distribu- tion F . We are interested in inferring the conditional excess distribution function F u . If the selected threshold u is high enough, for a large class of distributions F , the conditional excess distribution function F u converges to a generalized Pareto (GP) distribution [4]:\n⎧ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎩\nfor x ≥ u and 1 + γ/σ(x − u) ≥ 0, where γ ∈ R is the shape parameter and σ > 0 is the scale parameter.\nIf the random variable X has a GP distribution for a ﬁxed threshold u, the conditional distribution of X −t, given X ≥ t, corresponding to a higher threshold u+t, also has a GP distri- bution. The shape parameter γ t of the conditional distribution remains unchanged, i.e., γ t = γ, while the scale parameter σ t is a linear function of the threshold, i.e., σ t = σ + γt.\nA Markov random ﬁeld (MRF) or a graphical model is a collection of random variables indexed by the vertices of an undirected graph G = (V, E). Each node i ∈ V is associated with a random variable X i . An edge ( i, j) is absent if the cor- responding two variables X i and X j are conditional indepen- dent: P (X i , X j |X V|i,j ) = P (X i |X V|i,j ) P (X j |X V|i,j ), where V|i, j denotes all the variables except X i and X j . In particular, for Gaussian distributed X, the graph G is characterized by the inverse of the covariance matrix (precision matrix) K, i.e., K(i, j) = 0 if and only if the edge (i, j) ∈ E [8].\nThe thin-membrane model is a Gaussian MRF that is commonly used as smoothness prior. Such model tries to minimize the difference between neighbors, and its probability density function (pdf) can be written as:\nwhere N (i) denotes the neighboring nodes of node i, and α is the smoothness parameter. The matrix K p is the adjacency matrix: its diagonal elements [ K p ] i,i are equal to the number of neighbors of site i and its off-diagonal elements [K p ] i,j equal −1 if the sites i and j are adjacent and 0 otherwise.\nIn this section, we introduce our novel spatial extreme model (denoted as MRF-GP model), which is based on the following two assumptions:\n1) The threshold exceedance at each site follows a GP distribution (1) with threshold u i , shape parameter γ i , and scale parameter σ i .\n2) Spatial dependence is captured by the spatial-dependent parameters u = (u 1 , · · · , u p ), γ = (γ 1 , · · · , γ p ), σ = (σ 1 , · · · , σ p ), where p is the number of sites. Speciﬁcally, the three parameter vectors u, γ, and σ each have a thin-membrane model as prior. Conditioned on the spatially dependent GP parameters, the extreme values at different sites are mutually independent.\nFig. 1 shows the factor graph of our model [9]. For simplicity, we depict the GP pdf of only one site on the grid (node indicated by \u201cGP\u201d). The three rectangular lattices on the right hand side represent the thin-membrane models; the nodes α z represent the factors exp {−α z ( z i − z j ) 2 }, where z stands for either u, γ or σ.\nSuppose that we have n samples x (j) i at each of the p locations, where i = 1, · · · , p and j = 1, · · · , n. Our objective is to infer the three parameters u, γ, and σ.\nLet y = (y 1 , y 2 , . . . , y p ) denote the \u201cobserved\u201d value of z = ( z 1 , z 2 , . . . , z p ), where z is either u, γ or σ. In our approach, the \u201cobserved\u201d y i are computed at each site i from the n observed samples at that site. We model the observations as y = z+b, where b ∼ N(0, R z ) is a zero-mean Gaussian white noise with a diagonal covariance matrix R z .\nSince we assume that the prior distribution of z is a thin- membrane model (cf. (2)), the posterior distribution is given by:\nIn the following, we discuss how the \u201cobserved\u201d value y, the noise covariance matrix R z , and the smoothing parameter α z are computed for each of the three parameters u, γ, and σ.\nThe thresholds ˆ u i are selected so that the probability of threshold exceedance is identical (e.g., 5%) at all locations. The resulting thresholds are considered as local observations.\nThe local observed value of γ and σ is the vector of local maximum likelihood (ML) estimates ( ˆ γ i ML , ˆ σ i ML ) at each site, which can be obtained by numerically solving the following two coupled equations [11]:\nFrom a message-passing perspective, the local estimates ˆ σ i ML and ˆ γ i ML are chosen as the means of the Gaussian messages leaving the GP node along the σ and γ edges respectively, towards the thin-membrane subgraphs associated with σ and γ respectively [9].\nWe use the bootstrap approach (as in [12]) to infer the noise covariance matrices R u , R γ and R σ , and also the 95% conﬁdence interval of the estimates of γ and σ as follows:\n1) We generate m sample sets S 1 , · · · , S m , each with size n × p, by resampling at random with replacement from the original n observations (at each of the p locations).\n2) The thresholds u k = ( u k 1 , · · · , u k p ) are estimated by ﬁxing the same quantile value (e.g., 5%) for each of the m subsets S k , where k = 1, · · · , m. With that choice of thresholds u k , the parameters γ k = ( γ k 1 , · · · , γ k p ), and σ k = ( σ k 1 , · · · , σ k p ) are estimated using ML method (cf. (5)(6)) for each S k .\n3) The variance of u k i ( k = 1, · · · , m) at site i is our estimate of [ R u ] i,i , with i = 1, . . . , p. Similarly, we obtain estimates of the diagonal covariance matrices R γ and R σ .\n4) The 95% conﬁdence interval for γ and σ is estimated as the values corresponding to the 2 .5% and 97.5% quantiles of γ k and σ k .\nFrom a message-passing perspective, the diagonal elements of R u , R γ and R σ are the covariances of the Gaussian messages leaving the GP node towards the thin-membrane subgraphs [9].\nThe smoothness parameters α z are hyperparameters in the overall model. Through EM we obtain point estimates of those hyperparameters, whereas we infer the posterior distributions of z. Such procedure corresponds to an empirical Bayes approach [10].\nIn the M-step, we select the value ˆ α (k) z of α z that maximizes Q(α z , ˆα (k−1) z ). A closed form expression of ˆ α (k) z exists [13]:\n(8) where p is the number of sites. We iterate the E-step and M-step till convergence, yielding a local extremum of the marginal posterior of α z .\nIn this section, we apply the MRF-GP model to syn- thetic and real data. We compare it to a locally ﬁt model, where the parameters u = (u 1 , · · · , u p ), γ = (γ 1 , · · · , γ p ), σ = (σ 1 , · · · , σ p ) are all locally ﬁt through ML estimation (cf. (5)(6)), without taking spatial priors into account. We compare the MRF-GP and the locally ﬁt model based on three criteria:\n1) We verify whether the shape parameter γ i is independent of the threshold u i , and the scale parameter σ i depends linearly on u i (cf. Section II-A).\n2) We investigate how the shape and scale parameters de- pend on the threshold smoothness parameter α v . Earlier studies suggest that a properly selected threshold surface (sometimes combined with scale surface) is sufﬁcient to capture the spatial variation, and as a consequence, the shape surface may be ﬂat [6].\n3) We compute the 95% conﬁdence interval of all estimates by bootstrapping.\nHere we present results for two case studies with synthetic data. Samples are drawn from GP marginals with location- dependent parameters. In both cases, the threshold surface is a quadratic Legendre polynomial, as shown in Fig. 2(a), whereas the shape and scale parameters are chosen differently in each case.\n1) Case Study 1: The shape and scale parameters γ and σ respectively are chosen to be constant, and equal to - 0.3 and 4.4 respectively. We generate 1250 samples from the GP distributions at each site. From Fig. 3, we can see that the estimates resulting from the MRF-GP model follow\nthe predicted dependency on the threshold more closely: the shape parameter γ is nearly independent of the threshold u, whereas the scale parameter σ scales linearly with u (cf. Section II-A). Clearly, the local ML estimates ﬂuctuate more, and hence are less reliable. Moreover, the MRF-GP estimates have narrower conﬁdence intervals compared to the local ML estimates. Interestingly, Fig. 4 shows that for a large range of the threshold smoothing parameter α u , the estimates of γ and σ do not depend on location, which is also the case for the true parameter values. On the other hand, the local ML estimates are signiﬁcantly different at each site. Fig. 5(a) shows the mean square error (MSE) of the local and MRF-GP estimates, as a function of α u : the MSE of the MRF-GP estimates is more than a order of magnitude smaller than the MSE of the local estimates.\n2) Case Study 2: In the second case study, we extend the scale parameter surface to be quadratic, as shown in Fig. 2(b), however, the shape parameter γ remains the value -0.3 as in the previous case study. We wish to verify whether the MRF- GP model can capture the additional spatial dependence. The results are qualitatively similar to the ones of the ﬁrst case study. The only difference is that the estimates of σ are no longer independent of location (Fig. 6), which is not surprising since the true parameters σ follow a quadratic surface. In other words, by inferring α σ and α γ , the spatial smoothness of σ and γ can automatically and appropriately be adjusted. The MRF-GP estimates are more accurate than the local ML estimates, as shown in Fig 5(b), although the improvement is less pronounced than in Case Study 1 (cf. Fig 5(a)).\nWe consider the GOMOS (Gulf of Mexico Oceanographic Study) data [14], which consists of 315 peak wave height val- ues corresponding to hurricane events in the Gulf of Mexico. There are 78 sites arranged on a 6 ×13 rectangular lattice with spacing of 0 .125 ◦ (approximately 14km).\nThe MRF-GP model yields more accurate GP parameter estimates than local ﬁtting: The MRF-GP estimates of γ and σ again follow the predicted dependency on the threshold u more closely than the local estimates, and the 95% conﬁdence intervals are narrower (not shown here). However, also for\nthe MRF-GP, the parameter γ signiﬁcantly depends on the threshold u, which is also an issue for the approach of [6]. Consequently, selecting a threshold quantile is a delicate issue for the data set at hand. Interestingly, Fig. 7 shows that the MRF-GP estimates of the parameters γ and σ are identical for each site. The variation of the GP marginals across space can be captured effectively by a spatial-dependent threshold u only. Consequently, the MRF-GP model has vastly fewer parameter than for local ﬁtting (where all parameters are location-dependent), but achieves about the same loglikelihood (for a wide range of quantiles). Therefore, the MRF-GP model is preferred over local ﬁtting for the GOMOS data.\nWe introduced a novel spatial extreme model: the marginal excess probabilities are assumed to be GP distributions, and thin-membrane models serve as priors for the location- dependent GP parameters. The smoothness of the GP parame- ters across space can automatically be inferred from the data. In some cases, certain GP parameters may be become location- independent.\nZheng Choo wishes to acknowledge the funding support for this project from Nanyang Technological University under the Undergraduate Research Experience on CAmpus (URECA) programme."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"P.
