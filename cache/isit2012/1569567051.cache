If yes, the receiver stops and declares the current candidate message as its guess for the sent message. If no, the receiver tries the next candidate message and so on. If all candidate messages are exhausted, the receiver declares failure. Such a simple sequential decoding strategy works for example for the single sender single receiver channel as well as the many sender single receiver multiple access channel.\nFor a quantum channel, one can ask if the sequential decoding intuition from the classical world leads to a valid decoding strategy. To simplify the setting, we shall restrict ourselves to channels with classical input and quantum output. Note that an encoding and decoding strategy for such a channel immediately gives us, via standard arguments, an encoding and decoding strategy for sending classical information over channels with quantum input and quantum output without\nany entanglement assistance. For a single sender single re- ceiver unassisted classical-quantum channel, called cq-channel henceforth, Winter [8] gave a sequential decoding strategy that achieves rates up to the mutual information. Winter\u2019s decoding strategy used a sequence of POVMs. Recently, Giovannetti, Lloyd and Maccone [9] improved Winter\u2019s result by constructing a decoding strategy for the cq-channel that applies a sequence of orthogonal projections instead of a sequence of POVMs. Giovannetti et al.\u2019s decoder tries to project the sent message alternately onto the typical subspace of the average message and the typical subspace of the current candidate message. This leaves us wondering if a simpler sequential decoding strategy is possible, in particular, whether just projecting the received state onto the typical subspace of the current candidate message is good enough for decod- ing. Besides the two sequential decoding results mentioned above, other decoders for the cq-channel [10], [11], [13] use conceptually more complex strategies including in particular, the pretty good measurement also known as the square-root measurement [12]. Besides conceptual simplicity, a sequential decoding strategy with orthogonal projections offers efﬁciency advantages in some settings. For a start, such a strategy can be implemented in work space polynomial in the number of qubits of the received message. It is unknown whether a sequential decoding strategy with POVMs can be implemented in polynomial space; the naive method of implementing an exponentially long sequence of POVMs uses an exponential number of qubits. In practically important settings like optical channels, a sequential decoder using projections onto condi- tionally typical subspaces seems much easier to implement than a decoder using the pretty good measurement [5].\nIn this paper, we ﬁrst construct a sequential decoding scheme for the cq-channel where the decoder just tries to project the received state onto the typical subspace of the cur- rent candidate message. We show that even this simple scheme can achieve rates up to the mutual information. We then construct a sequential decoder making orthogonal projections for the two sender single receiver multiple access channel with classical input and quantum output, called ccq-MAC hence- forth, achieving the standard inner bound for this channel. For this, we have to replace the standard conditionally typical projectors by a new kind of conditionally typical projector approximating the intersection of two conditionally typical subspaces. The existence of such suitable projectors follows from a powerful geometric fact about how two subspaces\ninteract. Our sequential decoding strategy for the ccq-MAC is \u2018jointly typical\u2019 or \u2018simultaneous\u2019. Until very recently, the only decoders known for the ccq-MAC were of the \u2018succes- sive cancellation\u2019 variety (e.g. [7]). Simultaneous decoders are crucial in proving many results in classical multiuser information theory. The lack of simultaneous decoders in the quantum setting is a major stumbling block in the development of multiuser quantum information theory. Our simultaneous decoder for the ccq-MAC should be an important ﬁrst step towards the development of a powerful multiuser quantum information theory. Another simultaneous decoder for the ccq- MAC was discovered very recently by Fawzi et al. [4].\nFinally, as the main application of our methods, we con- struct an encoding and decoding scheme achieving the Chong- Motani-Garg [1] inner bound for a two sender two receiver interference channel with classical input and quantum out- put, called ccqq-IC henceforth. The Chong-Motani-Garg inner bound is known to be equivalent [2] to the Han-Kobayashi [3] inner bound, which is the best known inner bound for the interference channel in the classical setting. This answers an open question raised recently by Fawzi et al. [4]. The Chong- Motani-Garg and Han-Kobayashi inner bounds are not known to be achievable by successive cancellation. Some previous works [16], [17] have attempted to achieve these inner bounds using rate splitting; however they suffer from the bug that rate spitting according to the convenience of one receiver may not be good for the other receiver. We prove the Chong- Motani-Garg inner bound for the ccqq-IC by analysing, as in the classical case, a special three sender single receiver classical-quantum multiple access channel, called CMG-MAC henceforth. We prove an inner bound for the CMG-MAC using our techniques which turns out to be larger than Chong, Motani and Garg\u2019s classical inner bound for the same encoding strategy! However, this improved inner bound does not enlarge the Chong-Motani-Garg region for the interference channel. Our encoding scheme is the same as that of Chong-Motani- Garg, and our decoding scheme is sequential.\nAn expanded version of this work with detailed proofs can be found at [6].\nWe use standard facts about typical subspaces from to prove the following asymptotic smoothing lemma. It will be applied in the analysis of the decoding error probabilities of all our decoders henceforth. A proof can be found in the expanded version.\nLemma 1. Let XZY B be a classical-classical-classical- quantum system with joint density matrix\np X (x)p Z|X (z|x)p Y (y) |x, z, y x, z, y| ⊗ ρ xzy .\nLet n ≥ 4δ −2 p −1 min q −1 min log(|B||X ||Z||Y|/ ). Deﬁne c(δ) := δ log |B||X ||Z||Y| − δ log δ. Then there is an ensemble of density matrices {ρ B n x n z n y n } (x n ,z n ,y n )∈X n ×Z n ×Y n such that for\np X n (x n )p Z n |X n (z n |x n )p Y n (y n ) |x n , z n , y n x n , z n , y n | ⊗ ρ B n x n z n y n ,\nIn this paper, the term orthogonal projector will refer to a Hermitian matrix with eigenvalues 0 and 1. We shall hence- forth use the word projector in place of orthogonal projector. The following geometric property is crucial to our construction of a decoding strategy consisting of a sequence of projectors. The advantage with respect to Winter\u2019s \u2018gentle measurement\u2019 lemma [8] is that in the gentle measurement lemma square roots of the error probabilities under the operations add up, whereas in our lemma we exploit the fact that each operation is an orthogonal projection to obtain that the error probabilities add up. Using Naimark\u2019s theorem to convert POVM elements to orthogonal projections on larger Hilbert spaces, we get the same result for lower bounding the success probability of a sequence of POVM elements applied to a mixed initial state. Our lemma allows us to avoid dependencies between the decoding operations that were there in earlier sequential decoding strategies e.g. in Winter\u2019s strategy [8]. It can be thought of as a noncommutative union bound and allows us to lower bound the decoding success probability in a manner very similar to the classical setting. The proof can be found in the expanded version.\nLemma 2 (Noncommutative union bound). Let ρ be a positive operator on a Hilbert space and Tr ρ ≤ 1. Let Π 1 , . . . , Π k\nbe projectors. Let Π i := 1 1 − Π i be the projector onto the subspace orthogonal to the support of Π i . Then,\nLemma 2 suggests the following natural sequential decoding paradigm for a channel. Let Π 1 , . . . , Π k , . . . be projectors. Intuitively, if the ith message were sent, the output state ρ i of the channel would have a large projection onto Π i i.e. Tr Π i ρ i ≈ 1. Supppose now that the kth message is sent resulting in output state ρ k of the channel. The decoder tries to project ρ k onto Π 1 . If he fails, he then tries to project the collapsed state onto Π 2 . The decoder continues in this fashion. If he succeeds in projecting onto Π i for some i, he declares i to be his guess for the sent message. If he fails to project onto any Π i , he declares failure. Using Lemma 2, we can upper bound the decoding error probability err(k) of this strategy by\nOur quantum sequential decoding paradigm is very analogous to the natural classical sequential decoding paradigm, and gives low decoding error probability for any set of messages {1, 2, . . .} with channel output states {ρ 1 , ρ 2 , . . .} if we can ﬁnd, for example, a set of decoding projectors {Π 1 , Π 2 , . . .} with the property that for each k, Tr [ρ k Π k ] ≈ 1 and\nTr [ρ k Π i ] ≈ 0. In contrast, the sequential decoding approach of Winter [8] requires extra conditions on the de- coding projectors that involve requiring a sequential ordering of the messages, which leads to difﬁculties in applying it to channels with multiple independent senders. The sequential decoding approach of Giovannetti, Lloyd and Maccone [9] is heavily tied to the setting of the cq-channel and requires independent choice of codewords for different messages in the error analysis, which again leads to problems in applying it to channels with multiple independent senders.\nIn order to construct a simultaneous sequential decoder for the cq-MAC, we will need the following geometric fact about how a pair of subspaces interact.\nFact 1. Let A, B be subspaces of a Hilbert space H. Then there is a decomposition of H as an orthogonal direct sum of the following types of spaces:\n5) Two dimensional spaces intersecting A, B each in one dimensional spaces.\nMoreover, the one dimensional spaces in (2) and (3) above and the one dimensional intersections with A of the two dimensional spaces in (5) above form an orthonormal basis of A. A similar statement holds for B.\nUsing Fact 1, we can prove the following lemma. This lemma will be useful in designing a simultaneous decoder for a ccq-MAC, performing a sequence of projections. The lemma gives us a notion of approximate intersection of two conditionally typical subspaces. A proof can be found in the expanded version.\nLemma 3. Let A , B be subspaces of a Hilbert space H. Let Π A , Π B denote the projectors onto A , B . Let 0 ≤\n< 1. Then there exists a (possibly null) subspace A of A such that for all vectors v ∈ A, Π B v 2 2 ≥ (1 −\n. Let B be the (possibly null) subspace of B spanned by the vectors Π B v, v ∈ A. Let Π B be the projector onto B. Then, Π B ≤ (1 −\nB Π A Π B . Suppose furthermore there is a positive matrix ρ, Tr ρ ≤ 1 with support in A such that Tr [ρΠ B ] ≥ 1 − . Then A is a non-null subspace and Tr [ρΠ B ] ≥ 1 − 2\nLet C : x → ρ x be a channel which takes a classical input x and outputs a quantum state ρ x . We use ρ XB :=\np X (x)|x x|⊗ρ x to denote the joint state of the system XB. For x n ∈ T X n δ , let Π x n denote the conditionally typical projector Π ρ xn δ . For x n ∈ T X n δ , deﬁne Π x n := 0. Suppose the sender wants to transmit at rate R using n independent uses of the channel C. Let his messages be denoted by m, 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 nR . The sender uses the random encoding strategy of Figure 1 to choose a codebook C.\nFor the codebook C, the receiver uses the sequential decoding strategy of Figure 2. An interesting feature about our decoder is that it only uses projectors onto conditionally typical subspaces of candidate messages. In particular, it does not use any projection onto the typical subspace of the average message, unlike Giovannetti, Lloyd and Maccone\u2019s sequential decoder [9] and many other decoders for the cq-channel described earlier in the literature. The only other example of a decoder for the cq-channel that solely uses projectors onto conditionally typical subspaces of candidate messages that we are aware of is a pretty good measurement based decoder of Wilde [15, Exercises 15.5.4 and 19.3.5].\nIn order to analyse the success probability of decoding a message correctly, we ﬁrst imagine that we are given a slightly different channel C working on alphabet X n with output Hilbert space B ⊗n . It is deﬁned as C : x n → ρ x n where the states {ρ B n x n } x n ∈X n are as provided by Lemma 1 given state ρ XB . Let ρ X n B n be as deﬁned by Lemma 1. The encoding and decoding strategies used continue to be exactly\n\u2022 For m = 1 to 2 nR , repeat the following till ﬁrst success;\n\u2013 Let τ m be the state at the beginning of loop number m;\n\u2013 Project τ m onto Π x n (m) . If fail proceed to next iteration (note that the state changes), else declare success and announce m to be the guess for the sent message.\n\u2022 If all candidate messages are exhausted without success, abort.\nas in Figures 1 and 2, even though the channel we are now working with is a single copy of C .\nFor 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 nR , deﬁne ˆ Π x n (m) := 1 1 − Π x n (m) to be the projector corresponding to failing to project onto Π x n (m) . The success probability of decoding message m correctly for a single copy of channel C is\nWe shall use the symbol E [·] to denote expectation over the choice of the random codebook C. The expected error probability E [err(m)] of decoding message m is now at most\nThe second inequality follows from concavity of square root. The equality follows from the independent and identical choice of codewords for a pair of different messages.\nWe now bound the terms on the right hand side above. For x n ∈ T X n δ ,\nwhere we use Lemma 1. If x n ∈ T X n δ , Π x n = 0 and the upper bound on the trace above holds trivially. Again, for x n ∈ T X n δ ,\nwhich shows that we can achieve any rate less than the mutual information. Since we have shown that E [err(m)] is small for all messages m, the expected average error probability E [err C ] := E [2 −nR m err C (m)] for channel C is also small. By continuity, the same is true for n copies of the original channel C using the same encoding and decoding procedures described in Figures 1 and 2.\nA similar random encoding and sequential decoding strategy gives us the standard inner bound for a channel C : (x, y) → ρ xy that takes two classical inputs x and y and outputs a quantum state ρ xy in Hilbert space B. The difference now is that the receiver applies a sequence of projectors ˜ Π x n y n that serve as an approximate intersection of Π x n y n , Π y n . More precisely, we treat the supports of Π x n y n , Π y n as the subspaces A , B of Lemma 3, and obtain ˜ Π x n y n as the projector Π B promised by Lemma 3. If x n y n ∈ T (XY ) n δ \t , deﬁne ˜ Π x n y n := 0. This allows us to bound the following term that arises in the decoding error analysis, when we consider the expected probability of error that occurs when actually a message (m 1 , m 2 ) is transmitted but the receiver tests whether the output state corresponds to message (m 1 , m 2 ), m 1 = m 1 .\nwhere we use the deﬁnition of ˜ Π x n y n and Lemma 3. If x n y n ∈ T (XY ) n δ \t , then ˜ Π x n y n = 0 and the upper bound on the trace above holds trivially. Fix y n ∈ T Y n δ . We get\nIf y n ∈ T Y n δ , then for all x n ∈ X n , x n y n ∈ T (XY ) n δ \t and ˜ Π x n y n = 0, so the above upper bound on E x n [Tr [ ˜ Π x n y n ρ\n]] holds trivially. The other two cases in the decoding error analysis can be handled using Lemma 1 similar to the proof\nfor the cq-channel. This allows us to achieve the standard inner bound for the ccq-MAC using a simultaneous decoder. Details can be found in the expanded version of the paper.\nWe ﬁrst describe the so-called Chong-Motani-Garg three- sender MAC, called CMG-MAC for short. Let C : (z, y) → ρ zy be a channel that takes two classical inputs z and y and outputs a quantum state ρ zy . Let X, Z, Y be classical random variables such that Y is independent of XZ. We deﬁne\nto denote the joint state of the system XZY B. In the CMG- MAC there are three senders and one receiver. Let their messages be denoted by m 1 , m 2 , m 3 . The senders are forced to use a random encoding strategy where the codeword for sender 2 is chosen conditional to the codeword of sender 1. Thus, the encoding strategies of senders 1 and 2 are not independent in general. However, the encoding strategy of sender 3 is independent from that of senders 1 and 2. In the classical setting, the receiver is only interested in recovering the message pair (m 1 , m 2 ) correctly. This indifference towards m 3 is modelled by requiring the received word to be jointly typical with a triple (m 1 , m 2 , m 3 ) where only (m 1 , m 2 ) has to be unique. In other words, the receiver checks whether the received word lies in the union, over m 3 , of the typical sets for (m 1 , m 2 , m 3 ) for a unique (m 1 , m 2 ). A naive quantum analogue would be to replace the union of sets by the span of subspaces. However, this leads to a problem because of the geometric fact that a vector can have a large projection onto the span of two subspaces even though its projections onto the individual subspaces are small. In fact, the vector can even lie in the span! However, it turns out that requiring the receiver to also decode m 3 correctly does not decrease the achievable inner bound for the interference channel even though it decreases the achievable inner bound for the CMG- MAC. We thus prove the following inner bound for the CMG- MAC. Note that the ﬁrst constraint, namely the constraint on R 3 , is what shrinks the quantum inner bound with respect to the classical.\nThe proof is similar to that of the ccq-MAC described above, but exploits the dependence between X and Z in a crucial way. We can ﬁnally achieve the Chong-Motani-Garg inner bound for the ccqq-IC using the above inner bound for the CMG- MAC using a geometric analysis of the rate region and other standard techniques. Details can be found in the expanded version of the paper.\nFinally, we note that if X and Z were actually independent, that is, if we had to code for a three sender MAC, then our techniques would fail. Finding a simultaneous decoding\nstrategy for a MAC with classical inputs and quantum output with arbitrarily many senders is the main problem left open by this work. Solving it would likely allow us to extend many results in classical network information theory to the quantum setting.\nWe are grateful to Omar Fawzi for allowing his observation that the smaller inner bound on the CMG-MAC does not lead to a shrinking of the Chong-Motani-Garg inner bound for the interference channel, to be included in the paper.
