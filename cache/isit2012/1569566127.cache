Space-time coding is an e ﬀective way to explore the potential provided by the MIMO channels. Orthogonal space-time block codes (OSTBC) [1] provide a promising transmission scheme due to the full diversity and linear decoding complexity.\nwhere s k , k = 1, 2, ..., K, are K real information symbols, which are usually the components of symbols from any complex constellations, and (A 1 , A 2 , ..., A K ) is a set of T × N T complex matrices called dispersion matrices. A set of su ﬃcient and necessary conditions for C to be an OSTBC [1] or a so- called unrestricted full-rank single-symbol decodable design [2] is listed below:\nii) A H m A l + A H l A m = 0, where 1 ≤ m l ≤ K. \t (2) The condition ii) is named as \u201cgeneralized orthogonal con- straint (GOC)\u201d in [3], which is equivalent to a condition that all the symbols s 1 , s 2 , ..., s K can be decoupled completely. As we know, satisfying both conditions i) and ii) is su ﬃcient for a STBC to obtain full diversity without any constella- tion restriction [2], and meanwhile to employ individual real symbol maximum-likelyhood (ML) decoding. Moreover, such codes (like OSTBCs) can still achieve full diversity even if the simple zero-forced (ZF) decoding is used due to orthogonality.\nAlbeit many advantages above-mentioned, a biggest problem is that the code rate is impossible more than one under such restricted conditions i) and ii) when complex constellations and more than two transmit antennas are used. Then, in open- loop systems, there does not exist such a code which has all the good features like OSTBC and also obtain rate one for any number of transmit antennas.\nIn the case of that partial channel state information (CSI) is available at the transmitter, some e ﬀective transmission schemes in [4-7], which may perform single complex (or real) symbol decoding, are introduced recently. Several weight vector books designs are presented in [4] and [5] for beam- forming systems by using quantized feedback to obtain the beneﬁt of array gain, which have rate one but do not consider the diversity order. An OSTBC based on unitary precoding is given in [6] to provide both array gain and full diversity, but rate one may not be assured in any number of transmit antennas. In addition, a partly orthogonal design (POD) in [7] is introduced to maximize the received signal to noise ratio (SNR) and also obtain full diversity. However, the full diversity may not be guaranteed when ZF decoding is used at the receiver. In summary, those closed-loop schemes in [4-7] do not obtain all the above-mentioned advantages of OSTBC and at the same time have rate one for any number of transmit antennas yet.\nIn this paper, ﬁrst an explicit construction of STBC which satisﬁes just GOC condition is given, where rate 1 is obtained for any number of transmit antennas due to relaxing the condi- tion i). Then we propose an adaptation strategy to achieve full diversity by using a few bits feedback for the constructed rate 1 code, which retains comparable ML decoding complexity with OSTBCs. At the same time, the proposed adaptive code does not lose full diversity when ZF decoding is used at the receiver. This idea is inspired by the work by R. Calderbank to use partial CSI to choose the higher diversity codes from a codebook through limited feedback [8], which is also a full diversity code under ZF decoding. But the numerical results show that our code outperforms the adaptive code in [8].\nNotation: In the sequel, C M 1 ×M 2 denotes a complex space with dimensions M 1 × M 2 .

For clarity, the matrices A k , k = 1, ..., K, are sometimes expressed as two-index notation A gm , g = 1, ..., N and m = 1, ..., M. In fact, they denote the same set of matrices: {A k } k =1,..,K = A gm g =1,..,N,m=1,..,M , where K = NM.\nIn this section, we will derive a completely decoupled model for the STBC with GOC. Considering a ﬂat fading MIMO system with N T transmit antennas and N R receive antennas, it can be modeled as\nwhere ρ is the SNR per receive antenna; Y ∈ C T ×N R is the received matrix; C ∈ C T ×N T is the codeword with entries from modulation constellations; H ∈ C N T ×N R is the channel matrix assuming constant during one codeword transmission and change independently from one codeword to the next; and N ∈ C T ×N R is the additive white Gaussian noise matrix. All the entries of H and N are assumed i.i.d. with distribution CN(0, 1). We normalize the codeword C obeying the energy constraint as E C 2 F = N T T and each A k has the equal energy of\nDeﬁne y j , h j and n j as the jth column of Y, H, and N , respectively. With some simple mathematical manipulations, we can derive a real model by combining (1) and (3), as\ny = ρ/N T H s + n \t (5) where y = [(y 1 ) T I (y 1 ) T Q ... (y N R ) T I (y N R ) T Q ] T 1 ×(2T N\n, n = [(n 1 ) T I (n 1 ) T Q ...

Therefore,\nH T H = diag ([d 1 , d 2 , ..., d K ]) \t (7) where d k = N R j =1 ¯h T j ¯ A T k ¯ A k ¯h j , k = 1, 2, ..., K, which can be rewritten using complex dispersion matrices and channel as\nThen, the completely decoupled equivalent real channel model can be obtained by multiplying left and right hand sides of equation (5) by a matched ﬁlter D −1 H T\nr = ρ/N T Ds + w \t (10) where r = D −1 H T y is a new K × 1 received vector obtained after match ﬁltering; w = D −1 H T n is K × 1 noise vector and the entries of w are i.i.d. variable with distribution CN(0, 1/2). The resulting equivalent channel for each element of s 1 , s 2 , ..., s K is then a single-input-single-output (SISO) channel\n= 1, 2, ..., K. So the symbols can be decoded individually if they are independent to each other. In addition, due to the columns orthogonality of H , the ZF decoding is always equivalent to ML decoding [10].\nIn this section, we give an explicit construction of com- pletely decoupled rate one STBC. That is to satisfy GOC and obtain rate one at the same time.\nTheorem 1: Consider a 2 × 2 OSTBC which consists of the following four dispersion matrices\nA gm = Γ m ⊗ E g \t (13) satisfy GOC, where m = 1, ..., M, g = 1, ..., 4, N T = T = 2M.\nProof : The proof is omitted due to clearness. \t Δ In the sequel, we construct Γ m , m = 1, ..., M, to satisfy\nthe above conditions. From (12), the columns in Γ m are orthogonal to the columns in Γ n , m n. Then they should locate di ﬀerent orthogonal subspaces of C M ×1 . Therefore, we present a construction of Γ m , m = 1, ..., M, as explained below.\nTheorem 2: Let η 1 , η 2 , ..., η M be a set of normal orthogonal bases of C M ×1 . Assuming Υ = [γ 1 , γ 2 , ..., γ M ], where γ m , m = 1, ..., M, be a set of column vectors of size M × 1, and satisfy the following two constraints\nProof : First, we prove the above Γ m , m = 1, ..., M, in (15) satisfy the condition in (12). The (15) is equivalent to say that the columns vectors within Γ m belong to the same subspace with only base η m . Since η 1 , η 2 , ..., η M are mutually orthogonal, the Γ m , where m = 1, ..., M, satisfy (12) obviously. Generally, η m , m = 1, ..., M, are recommended to be chosen as normal orthogonal bases with decentralized power distribution. Second, we give an explanation as follows about why we constrain Υ with the two conditions a) and b).\nA H gm A gm = Γ H m Γ m ⊗ I 2 ×2 \t (16) where m = 1, ..., M, g = 1, ..., 4, and K = 4M. Then, combining (4), (16) and N T = 2M, the following energy constrain of Γ m is obtained as\nwhere m = 1, ..., M, and Ξ is a M×M matrix with all entries 1. Substituting (18) in (17), we can derive γ H m γ m = M. Hence we let all the entries of Υ have the magnitude 1. The constraint in (14) will be used to derive (25) in section IV. \t Δ\nIn this section, we propose an adaptive strategy for the rate one STBC with GOC proposed in section III to achieve full diversity at the expense of limited feedback information, while preserving the same decoding complexity. Without loss of generality, we assume N R = 1 and H Δ = h N T ×1 .\nFirst, let we analyze the equivalent channel property of OSTBCs, which are the only codes satisfying GOC and full diversity. For an OSTBC, all A k , k = 1, 2, ..., K, are unitary, so that we can get d k = h 2 F from (8). Then, the model (10) can be rewritten as r k = ρ/N T h F s k + w k , where k = 1, 2, ..., K. When the channels h 1 h 2 ... h N T will not deeply fade simultaneously, the equivalent SISO channel h F will not be zero, then the signals s k , k = 1, 2, ..., K, can be theoretically recovered in the receiver. As a result, the N T orders transmit diversity is obtained.\nThen, let we consider the equivalent SISO channel of the above constructed rate one STBC with GOC. We still rewrite the (10) to r k = ρ/N T\n+ w k , where k = 1, 2, ..., K. As the weight matrices are not of full rank, we know from (8) that\n, h 2 , ..., h N T will not deeply fade simultaneously. This is the main di ﬀerence between OSTBCs and the constructed code and is also the reason why the constructed code has not full diversity.\nTo resolve the problem, our adaptive strategy is to adjust the K equivalent SISO channels to be close to h F as possible by a few feedback bits. The explicit introduction is:\nAccording to (16), the A H gm A gm , m = 1, ..., M , g = 1, ..., 4 have only M di ﬀerent patterns, then from (8) we know the d 1 ∼ d K have M distinct values, which are labeled with ˆ d m :\nand each of ˆ d m repeats 4 times in [d 1 , d 2 , ..., d K ], K = 4M. Design an adaptive ˆ γ m as follows:\nˆ γ m = diag e j θ 0 e j θ 1 e j θ 2 ... e j θ M −1 γ m , m = 1, ..., M (20) where θ 0 = 0 , and θ 1 , θ 2 , ..., θ M −1 are a set of phase control factors which are fed back from receiver to transmitter. Ob- viously, the ˆ γ m also satisfy the statements in Theorem 2. By replacing γ m with ˆ γ m and combining (16), (18) and (19), ˆ d m can be rewritten as\nwhere m = 1, ..., M and Ξ is a M × M matrix with all entries 1. Let N T = 2M and deﬁne M columns vectors with size 2×1 as h m = [h 2m −1 h 2m ] T , m = 1, ..., M. After some simpliﬁcations and combining with (20), ˆ d m can be further derived as below\nwhere γ im denotes the ith entry of γ m . Then, we use the following criterion to calculate the angles:\nOn the other hand, we hope that the determinant of the equivalent channel matrix D in (10), which also a ﬀects the coding performance [8], can be maximized.\nFrom (14) we know that the rows in Υ are orthogonal to each other, thus M m =1 γ ∗ lm γ im = 0 , i l . Combining (14), (22) and (23), it is easy to ﬁnd the following equation holds\nThen, the product M m =1 ˆ d m reaches the maximum when ˆ d m = h 2 F (m = 1, ..., M), which corresponds to the maximum of\ndet D H D . So, (24) is also equivalent to maximize det D H D . Finally, two examples are given about the adaptive strategy.\nIn a system with four transmit antennas, we let γ 1 = [1 1] T , γ 2 = [1 − 1] T and\nˆ γ m = diag([1 e j θ ]) γ m , m = 1, 2 According to (23) we can obtain\nwhere δ = h ∗ 1 h 3 + h ∗ 2 h 4 . If su ﬃcient feedback is used, which is to say that θ can be perfectly known at the transmitter, then ˆ d m = h 2 F , m = 1, 2, holds. So the code is equivalent to an 4 × 4 OSTBC with rate one.\nIn general, θ is quantized with log 2 (Q) bits as ˆq = arg min\nˆ γ m = diag([1 e j θ 1 e j θ 2 ]) γ m , m = 1, 2, 3 Similarly, from (23) we have ⎧⎪⎪\n(28) where δ 1 = h ∗ 1 h 3 +h ∗ 2 h 4 , δ 2 = h ∗ 1 h 5 +h ∗ 2 h 6 , and δ 3 = h ∗ 3 h 5 +h ∗ 4 h 6 . According to the criterion in (24), we suppose\nRe ( ξ 1 ) = 0, Re (ξ 2 ) = 0, Re (ξ 3 ) = 0 \t (29) With substitution of (28) to (29) and some simple mathemati- cal manipulations, we ﬁnd (29) is equivalent to the following equation\nThe optimal solutions of the equation (30) are obtained in (31)-(34). The details are omitted due to the lack of space.\nθ 1 = (Arg(δ ∗ 2 ) − 2Arg(δ 1 ) + Arg(δ 3 ) − α − β + π) 3 (31) θ 2 = (2Arg(δ ∗ 2 ) − Arg(δ 1 ) − Arg(δ 3 ) − 2α + β − π) 3 (32)\nIt is necessary to note that the equality in (30) will not be satisﬁed when the length of |δ 1 | , |δ 2 | and |δ 3 | cannot compose a triangle. In this case, we let δ 1 e j θ 1 + δ ∗ 2 e − jθ 2 + δ 3 e j( θ 2 −θ 1 ) be minimized by constraining the boundary conditions in (33) and (34). In practical engineering, for avoiding calculating inverse cosine and argument of complex numbers, the following searching method is recommended if the number of quantized bits is very small, as\nwhere θ 1 = 2πq 1 /Q , θ 2 = 2πq 2 /Q , q 1 , q 2 ∈ {0, 1, ..., Q − 1} and the number of feedback bits is 2 log 2 (Q).\nIn this section, we present some simulation results of the proposed adaptive codes with GOC, which is labeled with abbreviation \u201cA-GOC\u201d. All the simulations are considered assuming one receive antenna for simplicity.\nThe aim is to verify that the following expression always holds for any channel matrix h under a few feedback bits.\nwhere α is a certain positive constant independent on channel. If that, each of the equivalent SISO channels ˆ d 1 , ˆd 2 , ..., ˆd M will be more than zero when h 1 , h 2 , ..., h N T do not fade deeply si- multaneously, so that N T orders diversity is obtained, which is like the case of OSTBCs. If we use enough samples of channel matrices to calculate Λ min = min\nˆ d m h 2 F M , then it can be considered that Λ min ≈ α. The values of Λ min with di ﬀerent feedback bits are shown in Fig. 1 using N = 2 6 channel samples. We ﬁnd that Λ min ≈ 0 just in the case without feedback for both N T = 4 and 6. Just 2∼6 feedback bits used in the proposed adaptive code can already guarantee Λ min is a positive constant so that full diversity is obtained.\nTo verify that the proposed codes obtain full diversity with limited feedback, we refer to the performance of the four- group decodable STBC (4Gp-STBC) introduced in [11], which is a full diversity code with the lowest decoding complexity among the known rate-one codes for open-loop systems.\nThe performance of A-GOC through di ﬀerent number of feedback bits are shown in Fig. 2 for both four and six transmit antennas. The A-GOC uses 4QAM constellation and performs single-real-symbol ML decoding (labelled with SRSD) for N T = 4 . For verifying the equivalence of ZF and ML decoding, the A-GOC is decoded with both SRSD and ZF in the system of N T = 6 , where 16QAM constellation is used. Correspondingly, the 4Gp-STBCs also use 4QAM and 16QAM constellation, respectively, for N T = 4 and N T = 6 ; double and triple real symbols are employed to jointly decode, respectively, for N T = 4 and N T = 6. It is easy to see that when N T = 4, the A-GOC with only two feedback bits obtains\nbetter performance than 4Gp-STBC, and three feedback bits improves the performance by 1 dB, which is already close to the performance when full phase information is available. When N T = 6, it is shown that 4 feedback bits can improve performance by about 1.2 dB compared with that of the 4Gp- STBC. We also see that ZF decoding is always equivalent to ML decoding for A-GOC. In summary, with the expense of a few feedback bits, the A-GOC obtains full diversity and preserves linear decoding complexity and equivalence of ZF to ML.\nRecently, an adaptive Quasi-orthogonal STBC (labelled with A-QSTBC) with angle feedback was introduced in [8] to achieve full diversity but just using a simple ZF receiver for four transmit antennas. Compared with the performance of A-QSTBC with optimal feedback angle, we present the per- formance of A-GOC with 2 bits, 3 bits and optimal feedback angle in Fig. 3. The optimal feedback angle for A-QSTBC is chosen as ˆ θ = ∠(h 2 h ∗ 3 /h 1 h ∗ 4 ) assuming the availability of su ﬃcient feedback bits, which is described in [8]. All of the results are simulated with 4QAM constellation and ZF decoding. It can be seen that the A-GOC with just 2 feedback bits has slightly better performance than that of the A-QSTBC with optimal feedback. Furthermore, the gain increases to about 1 dB when 3 feedback bits is used.\nIn this paper, we give a construction of the rate one and full decoupled STBC. Based on the construction, an adaptive coding strategy is proposed to obtain full diversity under low-rate feedback. Basically, with the expense of a few bits feedback, the proposed rate one code obtains all the advantages of OSTBC, such as, having full diversity without any constellation restriction, performing linear ML decoding complexity, the simple ZF decoding reserving the equivalent\nperformance as ML. Numerical results show that our codes outperform the adaptive QSTBC in [8] under the same ZF decoding while using lower feedback expense.\nAcknowledge the National Natural Science Foundation of China for ﬁnancial support (Grant No. 61101098)."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"V.
