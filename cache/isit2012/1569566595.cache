It provides lower bounds on the number of samples required for any algorithm to learn the Markov graph structure of a probability distribution, up to edit distance. We ﬁrst prove a general result for any probability distribution, and then specialize it for Ising and Gaussian models. In particular, for both Ising and Gaussian models on p variables with degree at most d, we show that at least Ω((d − s p ) log p) samples are required for any algorithm to learn the graph structure up to edit distance s. Our bounds represent a strong converse; i.e., we show that for a lower number of samples, the probability of error goes to 1 as the problem size increases. These results show that substantial gains in sample complexity may not be possible without paying a signiﬁcant price in edit distance error.\nIndex Terms\u2014Markov networks, graphical models, strong converse, Ising model, Gaussian Markov model"},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"A.
