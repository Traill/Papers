However, despite the tremendous works dedicated to IA, the feasibility conditions of IA processing remains unclear for most network typologies. The IA feasibility analysis is challenging as the IA constraints are sets of high-degree polynomials, for which no systematic tool to analyze the solvability conditions exists. In this work, by developing a new mathematical framework that maps the solvability of sets of polynomial equations to the linear independence of their ﬁrst- order terms, we propose a sufﬁcient condition that applies to K-pairs MIMO interference networks with general typologies. We have further proved that the sufﬁcient condition aligns with the necessary conditions under some special conﬁgurations."},"body":{"text":"Interference has been a fundamental performance bottleneck in wireless communication. Conventional schemes either treat interference as noise or use channel orthogonalization to avoid interference. However, these schemes are non-capacity achiev- ing in general. Interference alignment (IA), ﬁrst proposed in [1], signiﬁcantly improves the performance of interference networks by aligning the aggregated interference from multiple sources into a lower dimensional subspace. For instance, in a system with K transmitter-receiver (Tx-Rx) pairs and N antennas at each node, the IA processing achieves throughput which scales on O\noptimal and well dominates that of conventional orthogonal- ization schemes, i.e. O (N log(SNR)). As such, there is a surge in the research interests of IA.\nTo achieve the optimal scaling law of throughput, the IA solution in [2] requires O((KN) 2K 2 N 2 ) dimensions of signal space, which is realized by time or frequency domain symbol extension. Such symbol extension approach is not scalable and is difﬁcult to implement in practice due to the huge dimensions of the signal space involved. To overcome this problem, IA designs with signal space dimension limited by the number of antennas, are proposed for practical MIMO systems. When the signal space dimension is limited, the IA is not always feasible. Therefore, the characterization of the feasibility conditions under limited signal space dimension is the primary issue to address. In general, the feasibility of the IA problem is associated with the solvability of a set of polynomial equations, which is the focus of algebraic geometry. There are very few works that studied the feasibility\ncondition of IA problems using algebraic geometry [3]\u2013[6]. In [3], the authors studied the feasibility condition of IA problem in single stream MIMO interference. This work has been extended to the multiple stream case by two parallel works [4], and [6], respectively. The two works have proposed some necessary conditions for MIMO interference networks with general conﬁguration, but the proposed sufﬁcient conditions are limited to speciﬁc conﬁgurations.\nIn this paper, we develop new tool in algebraic geometry which allows us to address the IA feasibility issue in the general conﬁguration. The newly developed tool maps the solvability of a set of general polynomial equations to the linear independence of their ﬁrst order terms. Based on this new tool, we can extend our understanding on the IA feasibility conditions in the following aspects:\nA. Further tighten the IA feasibility conditions from the necessary side;\nB. Propose and prove a sufﬁcient condition of IA feasibil- ity which applies to MIMO interference networks with general conﬁgurations;\nC. Determine the necessary and sufﬁcient conditions of IA feasibility in a wider range of network conﬁgurations comparing with the results given in [4]\u2013[6].\nFig. 1 compares and contrasts the new results established in this paper with all previous results on the IA feasibility conditions for MIMO interference networks.\nConsider a MIMO interference network consisting of K transmitter-receiver (Tx-Rx) pairs, with Tx k sending d k independent data streams to Rx k. Tx k is equipped with M k antennas and Rx k has N k antennas. The received signal y k ∈ C d k at Rx k is given by:\nwhere H kj ∈ C N k ×M j is the channel state matrix from Tx j to Rx k, whose entries are independent random variables following continuous distribution. x k ∈ C d k is the encoded information symbol for Rx k, U k ∈ C N k ×d k is the decorre- lator of Rx k, and V j ∈ C M j ×d j is the transmit precoding\nmatrix at Tx j. z ∈ C N k ×1 is the white Gaussian noise with zero mean and unit variance.\nFollowing the previous works on IA processing for K-pairs MIMO interference networks, in this work, we focus on the feasibility issue of the following problem:\nDesign transceivers {U k ∈ C N k ×d k , V j ∈ C M j ×d j }, k, j ∈ {1, ..., K} that satisfy the following constraints:\nDeﬁne the conﬁguration of a MIMO interference network as χ {(K 1 P 1 , J 1 Q 1 , d 1 ), (M 2 , N 2 , d 2 ), ..., (M K , N K , d K ) }.\nA. MIMO Interference Networks with General Conﬁguration The following two theorems summarize the main result on\nProblem 2.1 has solution, then the network conﬁguration χ must satisfy the following inequalities:\nmin(M j , N j ) ≥ d j , \t (4) max(\nd j , \t (5) ∑\nRemark 3.1 (Tighter Necessary Conditions): (5) is the newly proposed necessary condition. In fact, if the cardinality of set J sub is restricted to be 1, we have that (5) is reduced to\nwhich is one of the necessary inequalities given in the prior works [4]\u2013[6]. Please refer to the full paper for an example in which a network conﬁguration satisfy (4), (6) and (7) but not (5) 1 .\nTheorem 3.2 (Sufﬁcient Condition for IA Feasibility): If the following\nd k d j number of vectors in C\nd k (M k +N k −2d k ) are linearly independent, then Problem 2.1 have solutions almost surely.\nd k (N k − d k ), h kj (p, q) denotes the element in the p-th row and q-th column of H kj , k ̸= j, k, j ∈ {1, ..., K}, p ∈ {1, ..., d j }, q ∈ {1, ..., d k }. Moreover, for a given network conﬁguration χ, vectors {w kjpq } are either always linearly dependent or linearly independent almost surely.\nB. Special Conﬁgurations in which Necessary and Sufﬁcient Conditions Align\nCorollary 3.1 (The Symmetric Case): When the network conﬁguration χ is symmetric, i.e. d k = d, M k = M , N k = N , ∀k ∈ {1, ..., K}, and min(M, N) ≥ 2d, Problem 2.1 has solution almost surely if and only if the following inequality is true.\nRemark 3.3 (Backward Compatible to [4]): If we further assume that M = N , the feasibility conditions in Cor. 3.1 is reduced to 2N − (K + 1)d ≥ 0, which is consistent with the IA feasibility conditions given in [4].\nCorollary 3.2 (\u201cDivisible\u201d Case): When the network con- ﬁguration χ satisﬁes 1) d k = d, ∀k, and 2) d|N k , ∀k or d|M k , ∀k, Problem 2.1 has solution almost surely if and only if the following inequality is satisﬁed.\n1) Proof of Theorem 3.2: In the following analysis, we ﬁrst elaborate three lemmas, which, as illustrated in Fig. 2, construct a new systematic tool that links linear independence to the solvability of polynomial equation sets. The newly developed tool is not only the key steps to handle the IA feasibility issue in this work, but is also a good candidate of handling the solvability issue of sets of polynomial equations in general.\nLemma 3.1: Linear Independence Leads to Algebraic Inde- pendence: Suppose K is an algebraically closed ﬁeld. Consider polynomials f i ∈ K[x 1 , x 2 , ...x M ] which are given by:\nwhere g i are polynomials consist of terms with degree no less than 2. If the coefﬁcient vectors w i = [w i1 , w i2 , ..., w iM ], i ∈ {1, 2, ..., L} are linearly independent, then we have f i , i ∈ {1, 2, ..., L} are algebraically independent.\nLemma 3.2: Algebraic Independence is Invariant up to a Constant: Suppose K is an algebraically closed ﬁeld. If poly- nomials f i ∈ K[x 1 , x 2 , ...x k ], i ∈ {1, ..., L} are algebraically independent, and c i are independent random variables drawn from continuous distribution in K. Then g i = c i + f i are algebraically independent almost surely.\nFinally, we have the following lemmas which show that algebraic independence leads to non-empty solution set of a set of polynomials.\nLemma 3.3: Algebraic Independence Leads to Non-empty Vanishing Set: Suppose K is a algebraically closed ﬁeld. If polynomials f i ∈ K[x 1 , ..., x k ], i ∈ {1, ..., L} are algebraically\nindependent, then the vanishing set of these polynomials, i.e. V(f 1 , ...f L ) = {(x 1 , ..., x k ) : f i = 0, i ∈ {1, ..., L}} is non- empty.\nThe following Lemma transforms the IA problem (Prob- lem 2.1) into another equivalent form.\nLemma 3.4 (Problem Transformation): Problem 2.1 is e- quivalent to Problem 3.1 (deﬁned below) almost surely.\n{U k , V k } such that rank(U k ) = rank(V k ) = d k , ∀k ∈ {1, ..., K} and satisfy (3).\nTo ensure that rank(U k ) = rank(V k ) = d k , it is suf- ﬁcient to assume U (1) k ̸= 0, V (1) j \t ̸= 0, where U (1) k , V (1) k , are the matrices aggregated by the ﬁrst d k rows of U k , V k , respectively. Under this assumption, we can deﬁne ˜ U k ∈ C (N k −d k ) ×d k , ˜ V j ∈ C (M j −d j ) ×d j which are given by [\n. Then (3) is transformed into the following form:\n˜ u H k (n, p)˜ v j (m, q) = 0, \t (12) where h kj (p, q), ˜ u k (p, q), and ˜ v j (p, q) are the element in the p-th row and q-th column of H kj , ˜ U k and ˜ V j , respectively, w kjpq are deﬁned in (8), and\np ∈ {1, ..., d k }, q ∈ {1, ..., d j }, k, j ∈ {1, ..., K}, k ̸= j. Substitute (12) to Lem. 3.4 and Lem. 3.1 ∼3.3 sequentially, we can prove that Problem 2.1 has solution almost surely if vectors {w kjpq } deﬁned by (8) are linearly independent.\nNext, we show that for a given network conﬁguration χ, vectors {w kjpq } are either always linearly dependent or linearly independent almost surely.\nDenote W ∈ C C ×V as the matrix aggregated by the vectors {w kjpq }, where C = ∑ K k=1 ∑ K j=1 ̸=k d k d j , V = ∑ K k=1 d k (M k + N k −2d k ). Then {w kjpq } are linearly independent if and only if at least one of the C × C sub-matrices of W has non- zero determinant. Therefore, the statement is proved if the following proposition holds:\nProposition 1: Under a network conﬁguration χ, the deter- minant of a C ×C sub-matrix of W is either always zero or non-zero almost surely.\nLemma 3.5: Suppose x 1 , ..., x k ∈ C are independent ran- dom variables drawn from continuous distribution, f is a non- constant polynomial ∈ C[x 1 , ..., x k ]. Then f ̸= 0 almost surely.\nProof: When k = 1, from the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra [7], f (x 1 ) = 0 only has ﬁnite number of solutions. On the other hand, x 1 is drawn from continues distribution. Hence f (x 1 ) ̸= 0 almost surely.\nFor k ≥ 2, the lemma can be proved by using mathematical induction w.r.t. k. We omit the details for conciseness.\nFrom (8) and the Leibniz formula, the determinant of a C × C sub-matrix of W can be written as a polynomial f ∈ C(h kj (p, q)) with no constant term, where k ̸= j ∈ {1, ..., K}, p ∈ {1, ..., N k }, q ∈ {1, ..., M j }. Further note that the coefﬁcients of f is determined by the conﬁguration of the network χ. Hence, under a ceratin χ, f is either a zero polynomial or a non-constant polynomial. In the latter case, by applying Lem. 3.5, we have that f ̸= 0 almost surely. This completes the proof.\n2) Proof of Corollary 3.1 and Corollary 3.2: We will highlight a key lemma in proving both corollaries. Please refer to the full paper for the other details of the proofs.\nWhen vectors {w i } are linearly independent, we have that L ≤ M. Note that if the lemma holds when L = M, it must hold for all L ∈ {1, ..., M}. Hence we only need to consider the case in which L = M . We use contradiction to prove the statement. Suppose f i , i ∈ {1, 2, ..., L} are algebraically dependent. Then from the deﬁnition, there must exist a nonzero polynomial p, such that p(f 1 , f 2 , ..., f M ) = 0. Without loss of generality, denote p = p 0 + p 1 + ...p D , where p d contains all the d-th degree terms in p, D ∈ N. Then we\nNote that all the terms in the last bracket on the right hand side of (18) have degree no less than 2, from (18), p 1 (\nw M j x j ) = 0, ∀x 1 , ..., x j ∈ K. Denote y i =\nNote that the coefﬁcient vectors w i are linearly independent, w : [x 1 , ..., x M ] → [y 1 , ..., y M ] is a bijective linear map. Therefore, {y 1 , ..., y M } ∼ = {x 1 , ..., x M } = K M . Hence, from (19), we have that V(p 1 ) = {y 1 , ..., y M } ∼ = K M , which means p 1 must be a zero polynomial.\nSimilarly, when p 1 is a zero polynomial, by analyzing the coefﬁcients of the second order terms, we have that V(p 2 ) ∼ = K M and therefore p 2 is also a zero polynomial. By using mathematical induction, we can show that p 1 , p 2 , ...p D are zero polynomials and hence p a zero polynomial, which is a contradiction with the assumption that f i , i ∈ {1, 2, ..., L} are algebraically dependent.\nWe ﬁrst prove that g 1 , f 2 , ..., f L are algebraically indepen- dent. Then the Lemma can be proved by repeating the same trick L times. We use contradiction to prove the statement. Suppose g 1 , f 2 , ..., f L are algebraically dependent, i.e. ∃ non zero polynomial p such that p(g 1 , f 2 , ..., f L ) = 0. Without losing generality, order the terms in p according to the degree of g 1 and denote p(g 1 , f 2 , ..., f L ) =\ng n 1 p n (f 2 , ..., f L ), D ∈ N. Then we have:\nNote that since p D is nonzero, and c 1 is a random variable drawn from continues distribution, p \u2032 is nonzero almost surely. However, p \u2032 (f 1 , f 2 , ..., f L ) = 0, which contradicts with the assumption that f 1 , ..., f L are algebraically independent.\nSince {f i } are algebraically independent, from [8, Thm.0.4, Lecture 2], K[f 1 , ..., f L ] ∼ = K[y 1 , ..., y L ]. Hence, ⟨f 1 , ..., f L ⟩ ∼ = ⟨y 1 , ..., y L ⟩, where ⟨z 1 , ..., z L ⟩ denotes the ideal generated by z 1 , ..., z L . Note that ideal ⟨z 1 , ..., z L ⟩ is proper, i.e. does not contain 1, so is ideal ⟨f 1 , ..., f L ⟩. Therefore, from Hilbert\u2019s Nullstellensatz Theorem [9, Thm. 3.1, Chap. I], V(f 1 , ...f L ) is non-empty.\nDue to page limit, we will illustrate the outline of the proof via an example. Please refer to the full paper for the rigorous proof.\nConsider a 3-pairs MIMO interference network whose con- ﬁguration χ is illustrated in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 also shows that there exists a set of binary variables {c t kjpq , c r kjpq } that satisﬁes (14) ∼ (17).\nIn the following analysis, we will utilize the properties of {c t kjpq , c r kjpq } to show that:\nProposition 2: Vectors {w jkpq } are linearly independent almost surly.\nIf Prop. 2 is true in the network illustrated by Fig. 3, from Thm. 3.2, the example network is IA feasible almost surely.\nAs illustrated by Fig. 4, consider matrix W, which is aggregated by vectors {w jkpq }. Note that under this network conﬁguration, we have 10 polynomials in (12) and { ˜ U k , ˜ V j } have 10 elements in total, W is a 10 × 10 matrices. Hence, prove Prop. 2, we only need to show that W is nonsingular, i.e. det W ̸= 0 almost surely.\nThe major properties of W that lead to the nonsingular property are illustrated by Labels D, E, and F. We ﬁrst carefully arrange the order of vectors {w kjpq }. In particular, index sequences (k, j, p, q) that satisfy c r kjpq = 1 or c t kjpq = 1 are placed in the upper and lower part of W, respectively. Then as illustrated by Label C, we can partition W into four sub-matrices W 11 , W 12 , W 21 , and W 22 . W 11 and W 22 are block-diagonal as we have ordered the rows in W according to the constraint allocation policy {c t kjpq , c r kjpq }. In this example, the \u201c=\u201d sign always holds in (15), (16). Consequently, as highlighted by Label F, all the diagonal blocks of W 11 , W 22 are square matrices. Further note that the elements in a same diagonal block are independent of each other, all the diagonal blocks of W 11 , W 22 are full rank almost surely. Thus we have W 11 , W 22 are nonsingular almost surely, i.e.\nAs highlighted by Label B, an element in channel state matrices {H kj } may appear multiple times in W due to the multiple stream issue. For instance, in this example, h 13 (1, 3)\nappears in both w 1311 and w 1312 . This repetitive appearance of a same element adds to the difﬁculty of the proof. On the other hand, since c t 1311 = c t 1312 = 1, we have that h 13 (1, 3) appears in only W 22 . More generally, from condition (17), if an element h kj (p, q) appears in W 22 , it will not appear in other sub-matrices of W. Hence, as illustrated by Label G in Fig. 4, W 22 is independent of W 11 , W 12 , W 21 . From the Leibniz formula, we have:\nNote that W 22 is independent of W 21 W −1 11 W 12 . Substi- tuting (21) into (22), we have that det(W) ̸= 0 holds almost surely. This completes the proof for the example network."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"M. A. Maddah-Ali"},{"name":"A. S.
