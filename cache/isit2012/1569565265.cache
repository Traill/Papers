In this paper, we derive achievable rate regions for  two classes of 3-receiver BC  with side information available at  the transmitter, Multilevel BC and 3-receiver less noisy BC,  by  using superposition coding, Gel\u2019fand-Pinsker binning scheme  and Nair-El  Gamal indirect decoding.  Our rate region for  multilevel BC subsumes the Steinberg rate region for 2-receiver \ndegraded BC with side information as its special case.  We also  find the capacity region of  3-receiver less noisy BC  when side  information is available  both at the transmitter and  at the  receivers.
