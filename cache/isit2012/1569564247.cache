Partial coopera- tion here is in the sense that the encoders communicate with each other through ﬁnite-capacity links. The channel states are assumed to be governed by a Markov processes. Full channel state information (CSI) is assumed at the receiver, while only delayed CSI is available at transmitters. The capacity region is derived by ﬁrst solving the case of ﬁnite-state multiple access channels with common message, using rate splitting, multiplexing and simultaneous decoding in order to establish the achievability. The common message result is then used to derive the capacity region of the partially cooperative encoders case. Finally, we apply this result in order to obtain the capacity region for a ﬁnite-state Gaussian MAC with partially cooperative encoders.

This result was later used by Willems [1] as part of the achievability proof for the partially cooperative encoders setting, in a manner which is similar to the one that is presented in this paper. Willems showed that, in order to achieve the capacity region, the encoders should use the cooperation link to share parts of their private messages and then use a coding scheme for the ordinary MAC with a common message. Although Willems\u2019s model allows interactive communication between the encoders, both in [1] and later in [4] he showed that the optimality is achieved even in a single round of communication between the encoders. However, in all the above settings the channel was not time- varying.\nWireless communication is a good example of channels where the channel characteristics are time-varying. In a wire- less setting, the user\u2019s motion and the changes in the environ- ment, as well as the interference, may lead to temporal changes in the channel quality. In such communication problems, the CSI is often transmitted back to the transmitters from the receiver through output CSI feedback. Frequently, the CSI feedback is not instantaneous; the transmitters only have delayed information regarding the state of the channel. As it seems, the future of wireless communication is heading towards user cooperation for enhanced performance. This motivates us to investigate the case of a time-varying channel with partial encoders cooperation.\nWe model the time-varying channel as a ﬁnite-state Markov channel (FSMC) [5]. The channel state is determined on a per symbol basis, and governed by the underlying FSM process. The conference between the encoders takes place prior to transmission and is independent of the channel state.\nThe FSMC-MAC with delayed CSI and ignorant encoders, i.e., where no conference between the encoders is held, has been presented and solved by Basher et. al. [6]. The achiev- ability scheme in [6] used successive decoding in order to prove that the two corner points of the capacity region are achievable and then, using time sharing, the whole region was achieved. In our case, where conferencing takes place, a different approach was needed. Since a straightforward achievability proof for the conferencing model is a difﬁcult task, we started with solving the case of perfect cooperation (i.e. the common message case) with the same CSI properties\nare the capacity regions for (i) the common message case, (ii) the partially cooperative encoders case and (iii) the Gaussian model of the latter. The results are followed by a brief description of the proofs.\nIn this paper we investigate the capacity region of a ﬁ- nite state Markov multiple-access channel (FSM-MAC) with CSI at the decoder (receiver), delayed CSI at the encoders (transmitters) and partially cooperative encoders as illustrated in Fig. 2. In order to do so, we ﬁrst consider a different setting, which is the FSM-MAC with a common message (fully cooperative encoders) and the same CSI properties, see Fig. 1. The derivation of the capacity region for the common message setting forms the basis for the achievability proof for the FSM-MAC with cooperative encoders, as described above. Since most deﬁnitions for both channels follow similar lines, we start with the common message setting and then extend the description for the partially cooperative encoders setting.\nWe consider the communication system of FSM-MAC with a common message, CSI at the decoder and delayed CSI at the encoders with delays d 1 and d 2 , as illustrated in Fig. 1.\nA ﬁnite-state Markov channel is, at each time instant, in one of a ﬁnite number of states S = {s 1 , s 2 , ..., s k }. In each state, the channel is a discrete memoryless channel (DMC). with input alphabets X 1 , X 2 and output alphabet Y. Let the random variables S i and S i−d denote the channel state at times i and i − d, respectively. Similarly, denote by X 1 ,i , X 2 ,i , and Y i the inputs and the output of the channel at time i. The channel transition probability function at time i depends on the state S i , and the inputs X 1 ,i , X 2 ,i at time i, and is given by P (y i |x 1 ,i , x 2 ,i , s i ). The channel output at any time i is assumed to depend only on the channel inputs and state at time i. Hence:\nP (y i |x i 1 , x i 2 , s i ) = P (y i |x 1 ,i , x 2 ,i , s i ). \t (1) The state process, {S i }, is assumed to be an irreducible, aperiodic, ﬁnite-state homogeneous Markov chain and hence\nWe now deﬁne the communication system of FSM-MAC with CSI at the decoder, delayed CSI at the encoders with delays d 1 and d 2 , and partially cooperative encoders with communication link capacities between them C 12 and C 21 , as illustrated in Fig. 2. The channel deﬁnition is obtained from the deﬁnition described in Subsection II-A, by taking the common message set to be M 0 = ∅ and deﬁning the conference between the encoders. The conference between both encoders takes place prior to the transmission of a codeword through the channel and consists of consecutive pairs of communications, simultaneously transmitted by the encoders. The communication transmitted by each encoder depends on the message to be transmitted by that encoder and the previously received communications from the other encoder. We denote the communications transmitted from encoder j ∈ {1, 2} to the other encoder by V j .\nNote that here the state process is also independent of the conference communications,\n(8) We now describe the conference in greater detail as part of\nCode Description: An (n, , 2 nR 1 , 2 nR 2 , d 1 , d 2 ) code for FSM-MAC with CSI at the decoder, delayed CSI at the encoders with delays d 1 and d 2 and encoders connected by communication links with capacities C 12 and C 21 consists of:\n( ≥ 1) communication functions {h j,1 , h j,2 , . . . , h j, }, j ∈ {1, 2} (we use similar deﬁnitions to those in [1]).\nThe encoding function maps the message M j , j ∈ {1, 2}, and what was learned from the conference with the other encoder into channel input codewords of block length n. Each f j works through a sequence of functions f j,i that depend only on the message M j , the received communications from the other encoder and the channel states up to time i − d j . We note that since the encoding occurs only after the conferencing has ﬁnished, each f j,i depends on all received communications.\nconsecutive pairs of communication functions. There- fore, a conference is completely described by two sets of l communication functions {h 1 ,1 , h 1 ,2 , . . . , h 1 , } and {h 2 ,1 , h 2 ,2 , . . . , h 2 , }. Each communication function h 1 ,i (or h 2 ,i ), i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , }, maps the message M 1 (or M 2 ) and the sequence of previously received communications from the other encoder V i−1 2 (or V i−1 1 ) onto the ith communication V 1 ,i (or V 2 ,i ). Namely, the communications are deﬁned as:\nIn this section we present the main results of this paper. Assuming without loss of generality that d 1 ≥ d 2 , we ﬁrst present the capacity region for the FSM-MAC with common message and delayed CSI.\nTheorem 1: The capacity region of FSM-MAC with a com- mon message, CSI at the decoder and asymmetrically delayed CSI at the encoders with delays d 1 and d 2 , as shown in Fig. 1, is the closure of the set of rates that satisfy:\nR 1 < I (X 1 ; Y |X 2 , U, S, ˜ S 1 , ˜ S 2 ), R 2 < I (X 2 ; Y |X 1 , U, S, ˜ S 1 , ˜ S 2 ),\nwhere U is an auxiliary random variable with bounded cardi- nality.\nDue to lack of space we only give here an outline of the achievability and converse proofs. The reader is referred to [10] for the full details. In the achievability proof of the theorem we use rate splitting and multiplexing coding. The multiplexing is done using the delayed states, S 1 and (S 1 , S 2 ), which are known at encoders 1 and 2, respectively. The decoding of the message triplet (M 0 , M 1 , M 2 ) is done simultaneously. The simultaneous decoding yields a very large number of inequalities for the partial rates, which follow from the error probability analysis. The number of inequalities is then reduced using the Fourire-Motzkin elimination, ﬁnally yielding the capacity region in (15).\nThe converse uses similar ideas to those presented by Slepian and Wolf [3] regarding the common message, and Basher et. al. [6] regarding the delayed CSI. The auxiliary RV U is deﬁned as U i \t (M 0 , S i−d 1 − 1 ), thus explicitly representing the common message and the common knowl- edge of the state. Finally, we show that indeed the Markov relations U − S 1 − (S 2 , S ), X 1 − (U, S 1 ) − (S 2 , S ) and X 2 − (U, S 1 , S 2 ) − (X 1 , S ), hold.\nThe next theorem presents the capacity region of FSM-MAC with partially cooperative encoders and delayed CSI, which is the model of main interest. Theorem 2:\nThe capacity region of FSM-MAC with par- tially cooperative encoders, CSI at the decoder and asymmet- rically delayed CSI at the encoders with delays d 1 and d 2 , as shown in Fig. 2, is the closure of the set of rates that satisfy:\nV (˜ s 1 ) = E[X 1 |U (˜ s 1 ), ˜ s 1 ]. This is in fact the optimal estimator in the MMSE sense of X 1 given U for each speciﬁed delayed CSI S 1 = ˜ s 1 . From the structure of the terms in (15) it is clear that the substitution of U (˜ s 1 ) with V (˜ s 1 ) increases the region. Our next step is to substitute (X 1 , V, X 2 ) with (X G 1 , V G , X G 2 ), which are zero-mean jointly Gaussian RV\u2019s with the same covariance matrix as (X 1 , V, X 2 ). By doing so the region is increased even more and due to the special structure of their covariance matrix we get that X G 1 (˜ s 1 )− V G (˜ s 1 )− X G 2 (˜ s 1 , ˜ s 2 ) for any given (S, S 1 , S 2 ) = (s, ˜ s 1 , ˜ s 2 ). This result is obtained using Lemma 5 in [8], where a similar approach is employed in order to yield an upper bound. The upper bound obtained is stated in (17). Finally, we achieve that upper bound by setting (X 1 , U, X 2 ) as jointly Gaussian centered RV\u2019s, which are denoted by (X G 1 , U G , X G 2 ), for which the conditional PDF has the structure as stated in Theorem 2, thereby characterizing (17) as the capacity region of the Gaussian model.\nThis work was supported in part by the Marie Curie Reintegration Fellowship within the European Community Framework Program and by the Ministry of Defense."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"F.
