The channel is corrupted by an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) state sequence, which is noncausally known at transmitter 2. This model is a generalization of the point-to-point channel with noncausal state information known at the transmitter only, for which Gel\u2019fand and Pinsker established the capacity in [1]. The capacity of the Gaussian model was established by Costa in [2] via dirty paper coding. The model that we study here captures more communication features of the transmitter- side signal cognition and receiver-side signal interference in addition to random state corruption of the channel. Our goal is to study the performance (i.e., the capacity) of such a model and correspondingly design communication schemes to exploit the noncausal state information in the context of signal cognition and interference.\ninformation at transmitters have been studied recently. In [3], the interference channel model with two transmitters sending two messages respectively to two receivers as in the classical interference channel [4], [5] and with noncausal state information known at transmitters was studied. In [6], a model of the cognitive interference channel with state was studied, in which both transmitters jointly send one message to receiver 1, and transmitter 2 sends an additional message separately to receiver 2. Our model differs from this model in that the message known to both transmitters needs to be decoded at both receivers instead of at receiver 1 only as in [6]. Although the two models appear similar to each other, their bounds on the capacity regions have different forms as demonstrated in our recent work [7], and the transmission schemes achieving these regions are also different. This difference is also demon- strated by the two corresponding models without state studied respectively in [8] and [9], and in [10].\nIn our recent work [7], we studied the discrete memoryless case of the model shown in Fig. 1. In this paper, our focus is on the Gaussian case of this model, in which the outputs at the two receivers are corrupted by i.i.d. Gaussian distributed state sequences and Gaussian noise variables. We partition all these Gaussian channels into two classes based on channel parameters, and provide a comprehensive characterization of the bounds and capacity regions for both classes. For each class, we characterize the partial boundaries for the capacity region. Furthermore, for some special cases, we provide full capacity region for the channel.\nWe also study the cognitive interference channel with state known at both transmitter 2 and receiver 2. We establish the capacity region for a class of channels for both discrete mem- oryless and Gaussian cases. Based on this characterization, we show that certain Gaussian channels with state known noncausally only at transmitter 2 achieve the capacity region or partial boundary of the capacity region of the same model with state known both at transmitter 2 and receiver 2. This is similar to the result that dirty paper coding achieves the capacity of the Gaussian channel without state [2]. Here, the channel cannot achieve the capacity with both receivers knowing the channel state, due to the fact that transmitter 1 does not know the channel state.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we introduce the channel model. In Section III, we present results on the discrete memoryless channel, which are useful for studying Gaussian channels. In Sections IV and V, we\npresent our results for Gaussian channels. In Section VI, we present our results for the model with state also known at receiver 2. Finally, in Section VII, we conclude with a few remarks.\nWe consider a cognitive interference channel model with state (as shown in Fig. 1), in which transmitters 1 and 2 jointly send a message W 1 to receivers 1 and 2, and transmitter 2 sends a message W 2 to receiver 2. The channel is also corrupted by an i.i.d. state sequence S n , which is noncausally known at transmitter 2, but is not known at any other terminal. Transmitter 1 maps a message w 1 ∈ {1, . . . , 2 nR 1 } to an input x n 1 , and transmitter 2 maps a message pair (w 1 , w 2 ) with w 2 ∈ {1, . . . , 2 nR 2 } and a state sequence s n to an input x n 2 . These two inputs are then sent over the memoryless interference channel characterized by P Y Z |X 1 X 2 S . Receiver 1 is required to decode W 1 and receiver 2 is required to decode W 1 and W 2 with the probability of error approaching zero as the blocklength n goes to inﬁnity. The capacity region is deﬁned to be the closure of the set of all achievable rate pairs (R 1 , R 2 ).\nIn particular, we study the Gaussian channel with the outputs at receivers 1 and 2 for one channel use given by\nwhere the noise variables N 1 , N 2 ∼ N (0, 1), and S ∼ N (0, Q). Both the noise variables and the state variable are i.i.d. over channel uses. The channel inputs are subject to average power constraints P 1 and P 2 .\nIn the following, we deﬁne a number of channel conditions for classifying the channels.\nfor all P U X 1 X 2 S s.t. U → X 1 X 2 S → Y Z \t (4) \u2022 I(X 1 U ; Y ) ≥ I(X 1 U ; Z)\nIntuitively, if a channel satisﬁes (2), receiver 2 is stronger in decoding X 2 , and if a channel satisﬁes (3), receiver 1 is stronger in decoding X 2 . If a channel satisﬁes (4), receiver 2 is stronger in decoding W 1 , and if a channel satisﬁes (5), receiver 1 is stronger in decoding W 1 .\nIn this section, we provide one inner bound and one capacity result for discrete memoryless channels, which are useful for studying Gaussian channels.\nLemma 1.

For the cognitive interference channel with state noncausally known at transmitter 2, if it satisﬁes condition (5), the capacity region consists of rate pairs (R 1 , R 2 ) satisfying:\nAchievability of the above theorem follows from Theorem 1 in our previous work [7] by setting U = V and using (5) to remove the redundant bounds. The converse follows from the capacity region of the multiple access channel with state available at one transmitter given in [11].\nWe partition the Gaussian cognitive interference channel with state into two classes corresponding to |a| \t 1 and |a| > 1, and study these two classes respectively in this and next sections. In each section, we ﬁrst provide inner and outer bounds for these channels, and then characterize either partial boundaries or the capacity region of the capacity region for all channels.\nIf |a| 1, the Gaussian channel satisﬁes the condition (2). We ﬁrst provide an inner bound for this class of Gaussian cognitive channels with state.\nProposition 1. (Inner Bound 1) For the Gaussian cognitive interference channel with state noncausally known at transmit- ter 2, if |a| 1, then an inner bound on the capacity region consists of rate pairs (R 1 , R 2 ) satisfying:\nR 2 1 2 log(1 + P \u2032\u2032 2 ) \t (11) R 2 1 2 log(1 + P \u2032\u2032 2 )+\n) + 1 2 log(1 + P \u2032\u2032 2 )\nand P \u2032 2 , P \u2032\u2032 2 ≥ 0, P \u2032 2 + P \u2032\u2032 2 = (1 − ρ 2 21 − ρ 2 2s )P 2 .\nThe above theorem is based on Lemma 1 by choosing (T, V, X 1 , X 2 ) to be jointly Gaussian and employing dirty paper coding by choosing proper T for Y and V for Z.\nWe then provide another inner bound for the above Gaussian cognitive channels with state.\nProposition 2. (Inner Bound 2) For the Gaussian cognitive interference channel with state noncausally known at transmit- ter 2, if |a| 1, then an inner bound on the capacity region consists of rate pairs (R 1 , R 2 ) satisfying\nThe above theorem is based on Lemma 1 by employing dirty paper coding and choosing proper T and V for Z.\nWe provide two outer bounds for this Gaussian class, both of which are useful for characterizing capacity results in the following subsection.\nCorollary 1. (Outer Bound 1) For the Gaussian cognitive in- terference channel with state noncausally known at transmitter 2, if |a| 1, then an outer bound on the capacity region is given by Theorem 8 for the same channel with state known at both transmitter 2 and receiver 2.\nProposition 3. (Outer Bound 2) For the Gaussian cognitive interference channel with state noncausally known at trans- mitter 2, if |a| 1, an outer bound on the capacity region consists of the rate pairs (R 1 , R 2 ) satisfying:\nProposition 3 follows from an outer bound for the general discrete memoryless cognitive interference channel with state presented in Theorem 2 in our previous work [7] with further derivations for the Gaussian channel.\nFor Gaussian channels with |a| 1, we characterize partial boundaries of the capacity region.\nTheorem 2. (Partial Boundary of Capacity Region) For the Gaussian cognitive interference channel with state non- causally known at transmitter 2, if |a| \t 1, ﬁrst consider the inner bound 1 given in Proposition 1. We let ∆ = (ρ 21 , ρ 2S , P \u2032 2 , P \u2032\u2032 2 ), and use r 1 (∆), r 2 (∆),˜ r 2 (∆), r 12 (∆) to denote the three bounds on R 1 , R 2 , and R 1 + R 2 . Then the rate pairs (R 1 , R 2 ) are on the boundary of the capacity region if r 1 (∆ ∗ ) r 12 (∆ ∗ ) − R 2 and ˜ r 2 (∆ ∗ ) R 2 , where ∆ ∗ = argmax\nboundary of the capacity region with the state known at both transmitter 2 and receiver2.\nThen consider the inner bound 2 given in Proposition 2. Let r 1 (∆), r 2 (∆), r 12 (∆) denote the three bounds on R 1 , R 2 , and R 1 + R 2 . Then the rate pairs (R 1 , R 2 ) are on the boundary of the capacity region if r 12 (∆ ∗ ) − R 2 r 1 (∆ ∗ ), where ∆ ∗ =\nThe rate pairs given in the theorem is clearly achievable. They can also be shown to be on the boundary of either the outer bound 1 given in Corollary 1 or the outer bound 2 given in Proposition 3, thus the rate pairs are on the boundary of the capacity bound.\nIn Fig. 2, we demonstrate partial boundaries of the capacity region characterized in Theorem 3. We consider the channel deﬁned by the parameters P 1 = P 2 = Q = 1, b = 0.85, c = 0.9 and a = 0.8. We plot the boundaries of the two inner bounds given in Proposition 1 and Proposition 2, and the boundaries of the two outer bounds given in Corollary 1 and Proposition 3, respectively. Under this coefﬁcients set, the two inner bounds match with the corresponding outer bounds. It is clear that the boundary of the inner bound 1 matches the boundary of outer bound 1 when R 1 is bigger than a certain value, and this part is thus part of the boundary of the capacity region. We note that this part of the boundary also achieves the capacity region of the same channel with state also known at receiver 2. It can further be seen that the boundary of the inner bound 2 matches the boundary of outer bound 2 when R 2 is above a certain threshold, and this part is also part of the boundary of the capacity region.\nWe then give the capacity bounds for the Gaussian cognitive interference channel with state under two special conditions.\nTheorem 3. (Capacity) For the Gaussian cognitive interfer- ence channel with state noncausally known at transmitter 2, if\n|a| 1 and the channel satisﬁes the condition (4), the capacity region consists of rate pairs (R 1 , R 2 ) satisfying:\nProof: (Outline) The achievability follows from Lemma 1 by applying condition (4) and jointly Gaussian input distri- bution. Such a region then matches outer bound 1 in Corollary 1.\nRemark 1. The above theorem implies that the Gaussian cognitive interference channel with state known only to trans- mitter 2 achieve the capacity of the same channel with state also known to receiver 2 if the channel satisﬁes |a| ≤ 1 and condition (4). This is similar to the result that dirty paper coding achieves the capacity of the Gaussian channel without state [2]. Here, the channel cannot achieve the capacity with both receivers knowing the channel state due to the fact that transmitter 1 does not know the channel state.\nWe note that the above region matches the capacity in [6] of another cognitive interference model with state, in which W 1 is decoded only at receiver 1. This is reasonable because under the condition (4), receiver 1 is weaker in decoding W 1 than receiver 2, and hence, receiver 2 already decodes W 1 , which satisﬁes the additional requirement in the model of this paper.\nTheorem 4. (Capacity) For the Gaussian cognitive interfer- ence channel with state noncausally known at transmitter 2, if |a| 1 and the channel satisﬁes the condition (5), the capacity region consists of rate pairs (R 1 , R 2 ) satisfying:\nThe proof for the above theorem is omitted due to the space limitations. It can be shown that the above capacity region is equivalent to the capacity region of the multiple access channel with state given in [11]. This is reasonable because under the condition (5), receiver 2 is weaker than receiver 1 in decoding W 1 , and hence dominates the rate region.\nIf |a| > 1, the Gaussian channel satisﬁes condition (3). We ﬁrst provide an inner bound for this class of channels.\nProposition 4.

(Outer Bound) For the Gaussian cognitive in- terference channel with state noncausally known at transmitter 2, if |a| > 1, an outer bound consists of rate pairs (R 1 , R 2 ) satisfying:\n+ 1 2 log(1 + (1 − ρ 2 21 − ρ 2 2s )P 2 ) \t (17) R 1 + R 2 1 2 log(1 + P 1 + 2aρ 21\nFor those Gaussian channels with |a| > 1, we characterize partial boundaries of the capacity region in the following theorem.\nTheorem 5. (Partial Boundary of Capacity Region) For the Gaussian cognitive interference channel with state non- causally known at transmitter 2, if |a| > 1, consider the inner bound given in Proposition 4. We let ∆ = (ρ 21 , ρ 2s , P \u2032 2 ), and use r 2 (∆), r 12 (∆), ˜ r 12 (∆) to denote the bound on R 2 and two bounds on R 1 + R 2 , respectively. Then the rate pairs (R 1 , R 2 ) are on the boundary of the capacity region if r 12 (∆ ∗ ) ˜ r 12 (∆ ∗ ), where ∆ ∗ = argmax\nSimilarly as the proof for Theorem 3, achievable points are on the boundary of the outer bound.\nIn Fig. 3, we demonstrate the partial boundary of the capacity region characterized in Theorem 5. We consider the channel deﬁned by the parameters P 1 = P 2 = Q = 1, a = 1.5,\nb = 1.6 and c = 0.9. We plot the boundaries of the inner bound given in Proposition 4 and the outer bound given in Proposition 5, respectively. It is clear that the two boundaries match when R 2 is above a certain threshold, and this part is thus part of the boundary of the capacity region.\nAlso, under certain condition, we can characterize the full capacity region for Gaussian channels with |a| > 1.\nTheorem 6. (Capacity) For the Gaussian cognitive interfer- ence channel with state noncausally known at transmitter 2, if |a| > 1 and the channel satisﬁes the condition (5), the capacity region consists of rate pairs (R 1 , R 2 ) satisfying:\n+ 1 2 log(1 + (1 − ρ 2 21 − ρ 2 2s )P 2 ) where ρ 2 21 + ρ 2 2s 1.\nProof: (Outline) The achievability follows from Proposi- tion 4 by applying the condition (5). Such an achievable region matches the capacity region of the multiple access channel with state studied in [11], which is an outer bound. Therefore, the proof is concluded.\nIn this section, we provide the capacity region for a class of cognitive interference channels with state known at both transmitter 2 and receiver 2. This result has its own interest and is also useful for providing the tight converse for studying Gaussian channels with state known only at transmitter 2 as shown in Theorems 3 and 2.\nTheorem 7. (Capacity) For the cognitive interference channel with state known at both transmitter 2 and receiver 2, if it satisﬁes condition (2), the capacity region consists of rate pairs (R 1 , R 2 ) satisfying:\nR 1 I(X 1 U ; Y ) − I(U; S|X 1 ) R 2 I(X 2 ; Z |UX 1 S)\nThe achievability follows from Theorem 1 in our work [7] by setting Z = {ZS} and V = X 2 . We note that this theorem generalizes Theorem 6 in our work [7].\nTheorem 8. (Capacity) For the Gaussian cognitive interfer- ence channel with state known at transmitter 2 and receiver 2, if it satisﬁes the condition (2), the capacity region consists of rate pairs (R 1 , R 2 ) satisfying:\n) \t (20) R 2 1 2 log(1 + P \u2032\u2032 2 )\nwhere P \u2032 2 + P \u2032\u2032 2 = (1 − ρ 2 21 − ρ 2 2s )P 2 and ρ 2 21 + ρ 2 2s 1. The proof is omitted due to the space limitations.\nWe note that we have further shown the capacity region for both DMC and Gaussian channels without condition (2). These more general results will be included in a journal version of this work which is currently under preparation.\nIn this paper, we investigated the Gaussian cognitive inter- ference channel with state noncausally known at one trans- mitter. We partitioned Gaussian channels into two classes. For each class, we derived inner and outer bounds on the capacity region, and characterized either partial boundary of the capacity region or full capacity region. Furthermore, we established the capacity region for a class of cognitive interference channels with state known at transmitter and receiver 2 for both discrete memoryless and Gaussian cases. In particular, this capacity region was shown to be tight for certain Gaussian channels without state known at receiver 2.\nThis work was supported by a NSF CAREER Award under Grant CCF-10-26565 and by NSF under Grant CCF-10-26566."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"S.
