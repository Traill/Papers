One of the main responsibilities of the medium access control (MAC) layer in each network is to present a procedure to coordinate how the network users should access the shared wireless medium. The design of this procedure highly depends on the structure of the network and the type of the communicated data between the users. Some of these methods including the Time and Frequency Division Multiple Access schemes require a central or partial controller. The other types of access mechanisms do not have this central brain and each user decides independently to whether transmit in a given time slot or not. These methods are usually categorized in the category of random medium access protocols. ALOHA [1], CSMA, and CSMA/CD [2] are some examples of random access mechanisms.\nRecently, Minero, Franceschetti and Tse [3] have proposed a novel method with an information-theoretic nature which captures the behaviors of the nodes in a network for a general multiple access channel. In this model, the transmitters can independently be active with certain probability without having any knowledge about the status of the others. The random level of interference due to the random set of active transmitters is exploited to transmit different streams of data in different states, thereby recovering more information bits when fewer number of transmitters are active.\nIn this study, we explore the presence of random access in a symmetric two-user X network which is comprised of two transmitters, two receivers and four independent messages; one corresponding to each transmitter-receiver pair. In fact, X channel is the simplest Gaussian network in which inter- ference alignment technique is necessary in order to obtain the capacity or degrees of freedom. Interference alignment, ﬁrstly introduced in [4], was used to characterize the total\ndegrees of freedom of the X channel in [5] and [6]. It refers to a signaling scheme which leads the transmitted messages to overlap in the receivers where they cause interference while being distinguishable at the desired receivers. In [8], authors characterized the generalized degrees of freedom (GDOF) of this network using a deterministic approach combined with the interference alignment technique.\nThe deterministic X channel, physically is the same as the deterministic interference channel introduced in [9]. Recently, Niesen and Maddah-Ali in their arxiv report [10] showed that the binary deterministic (BD) model proposed in [9], although simpliﬁes the analysis of the channel capacity in certain scenarios, is not capable of capturing all of the channel charac- teristics needed for the characterization of the capacity region of a Gaussian X channel. Preserving more characteristics of the channel coefﬁcients, they introduced another deterministic model called Lower-Triangular Deterministic Model, which is used to characterize the capacity region for Gaussian X channel within constant bits gap.\nIn this study we consider a symmetric 2-user scenario in which the set of channels observed by each receiver is the same as the other one. We tackle the problem of throughput maximization in this scenario. In such a symmetric channel, throughput is an appropriate metric. Following the foot steps of Minero et al. [3], we assume each of the two transmitters are active with probability p independent of each other. In order to simplify our analysis, we adopt a deterministic approach.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. The system model as well as the Virtual Access Point (VAP) represen- tation, is presented in Section II. In Section III, The main results of the study are provided. Firstly, the upper bounds are derived for the achievable rates of the network. Then the Fourier Motzkin Elimination [11] is used to characterize the rate region, which is the convex hull of some corner points, for each of which an achievablity scheme is provided. The optimized throughput and the required signaling scheme is provided in Section IV. Finally Section V concludes the paper.\nConsider a symmetric two transmitter/two receiver syn- chronous X channel. The channel output y m [t] at receiver m ∈ {1, 2} and time t ∈ N is\nwhere x 1 [t] and x 2 [t] are the channel inputs, h mk is the (constant) channel gain from transmitter k to receiver m, and z m [t] ∼ N (0, 1) is additive white Gaussian receiver noise.\nFor problem setup,we use the Symmetric Binary Deterministic. Avestimehr et al. introduced the binary deterministic interfer- ence channel [7] which is the ﬁrst order approximation of the interference channel. In the binary deterministic channel, the received signals at Rx1 and Rx2 can be represented by:\nˆ y 1 = ⌊2 n 11 ˆ x 1 ⌋ ⌊2 n 12 ˆ x 2 ⌋ ˆ y 2 = ⌊2 n 21 ˆ x 1 ⌋ ⌊2 n 22 ˆ x 2 ⌋\nwhere ⌊x⌋ denotes the smallest integer rounds down x. In this model, n ij s represent the cut-off noise/path loss values of one transmitter relative to the other transmitter. Furthermore, by assuming the unity power constraints at both transmitters, the transmitted signal by Txi can be represented as a binary stream,as follows:\nHere, we use the general notation of the binary deterministic channel to approximate the Gaussian X-channel(which is so similar to the Interference Channel). Without loss of generality, we assume that each direct link is stronger than the cross links, i.e.\nwhere X i (t), Y i (t) ∈ F n 2 , for i = 1, 2 and S is an n × n downward binary shift matrix,\nThere are four independent messages {w 11 , w 12 , w 21 , w 22 } in the X channel, where w mk represents the message from transmitter k to receiver m. The unit average power constraint is assumed at transmitters. We deﬁne a rate R ij is achievable if there are deterministic functions f and g respectively for encoding and decoding such that receiver i can decode w ij with arbitrarily small probability of error as the block length is large enough.\nB. Random Access X Channel (RAC-X) and Virtual Access Point (VAP) Representation\nThe idea of Virtual Access Points (VAP) model was ﬁrst proposed in [3]. In this model, each receiver is substituted with a number of virtual ones, each of which corresponds to a set of of active transmitters. In this setting, we consider a Binary Deterministic X channel with two users, each goes active with probability p. We assume that the transmitters\u2019 states do not change during each transmission. In this setup, each sender transmits several streams of data, a subset of which will be decoded by the receivers when both transmitters are active (w X mk for m, k ∈ {1, 2}). When one of the transmitters is not active, another subset of messages w RA mk will opportunistically be decoded, where the index k determines the active transmit- ter. When both senders are active and the additive noises at\nFig. 1: Virtual AP model for a 2-user deterministic, symmetric X channel with random access feature.\nthe receivers have the same marginal distribution, the observed output at each receiver from its desired transmitted signals is a degraded version of its output when only one of them is active. In other words:\nIn order to simplify the analysis, based on the degraded message setup mentioned earlier, we split the rates as follows:\nWhere R ∗ is the amount of excessive rate which can be opportunistically decoded when one of the users is not active. Using the VAP model the equivalent network is modeled with the same transmitters which are always active but the receivers ate replaced by three distinct subsets of virtual receivers according to the different states of the transmitters (see Fig 1). In this setup, the channel throughput can be written as:\nIn this section, we ﬁrst derive the information theoretic bounds governing the achievable rate tuples for the proposed VAP model for the deterministic symmetric RAC-X. Then we characterize the capacity region as the convex hull of some extreme points each of which is achievable. As the exact characterization of the capacity region of the network is obtained, we ﬁnd the maximum throughput of the network. A. The Outer Bound\ndeterministic symmetric RAC-X , satisﬁes the following inequalities\nR X 11 + R ∗ 11 ≤ n \t (1a) R X 22 + R ∗ 22 ≤ n \t (1b) R X 12 + R ∗ 12 ≤ nα (1c) R X 21 + R ∗ 21 ≤ nα (1d)\nR X 11 + R X 12 + R X 22 + R ∗ 11 + R ∗ 12 + R ∗ 22 ≤ n(2 − α) \t (1e) R X 11 + R X 21 + R X 22 + R ∗ 11 + R ∗ 21 + R ∗ 22 ≤ n(2 − α) \t (1f)\nR X 11 + R X 12 + R 21 X + R ∗ 11 + R ∗ 12 + R 21 ∗ ≤ n \t (1g) R X 22 + R X 12 + R 21 X + R ∗ 22 + R ∗ 12 + R 21 ∗ ≤ n \t (1h)\nThe detailed proof of Theorem 1 can be found in [12]. Here we brieﬂy provide the intuition behind these bounds. The ﬁrst four inequalities (1a-1d) are directly imposed by the system model. The next four inequalities (1e-1h) are based on the multiple access bound for the channel. For example, (1e) can be derived from the MAC bound\nat receiver one, combined with the inequality R X 11p ≤ n(1−α), which is immediate result of the system model. The inequality (1i) is introduced in [10] for a general 2-user X channel. The last four inequalities (1k-1n) are totally information theoretic bounds derived from Fano\u2019s inequality using similar technique as in [10].\nIt can be seen that the rate region described by the set of linear inequalities in theorem (1) is a convex region. In order to\ncharacterize this region, it is enough to ﬁnd the corner points of this region. This is done by a simple method known as Fourier-Motzkin Elimination [11].\nUsing fourier-Motzkin Elimination, it is observed that the corner points of the system of inequalities in theorem (1) fall into four different subsets, according to the value of α belonging to one of the intervals [0, 1 2 ], [ 1 2 , 2 3 ], [ 2 3 , 3 4 ], [ 3 4 , 1]. Some of these corner points are dominated by each other, i.e. for two given vectors v 1 and v 2 , v 1 dominates v 2 if each coordinate of v 1 is greater than or equal to the corresponding coordinate of v 2 . If a dominant corner point is proved to be achievable, then all the other corner points being dominated by that are also achievable by decreasing some rates. Each of these corner points can be deﬁned as a vector, w = [R x 11 , R x 12 , R x 22 , R x 21 , R ∗ 11 , R ∗ 12 , R ∗ 22 , R ∗ 21 ] in Z 8 .\nThe table below shows the number of corner points and dominant ones for different values of α. The list of all dominant corner points can be found in [12]. Due to lack of space we do not list them all but will provide some charactresitics of them.\nα ∈ \t [0, 1 2 ] [ 1 2 , 2 3 ] [ 2 3 , 3 4 ] [ 3 4 , 1] Num. of Corner Points(CP) \t 21 \t 24 \t 32 \t 29\nIt is observed that for every value of α, there are 7 common dominant corner points in this system:\nv 2 =[n, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, n(1 − α), 0] v 3 =[0, 0, n, 0, n(1 − α), 0, 0, 0]\nv 4 =[0, 0, n(1 − α), 0, n, 0, nα, 0] v 5 =[n(1 − α), 0, 0, 0, nα, 0, n, 0]\nv 6 =[n(1 − 2α), 0, n(1 − 2α), 0, 0, nα, 0, nα] v 7 =[n(1 − α), 0, n(1 − α), 0, nα, 0, nα, 0],\nIt can be seen that for throughput maximization when α ∈ [ 1 2 , 2 3 ], the dominant corner point v 8 = [nα, 0, nα, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] plays a crucial role. For the case of α ∈ [ 2 3 , 3 4 ], for certain val- ues of user activity probability (p), the dominant corner point v 9 = [n(2 − 2α), n(3α − 2), n(2 − 2α), n(3α − 2), 0, 0, 0, 0] maximizes the throughput. Finlay for α ∈ [ 3 4 , 1] the dominant rate tuple maximizing throughput for some values of p is v 10 = [⌊n − nα 3 ⌋ − ⌊ nα 3 ⌋, ⌊ nα 3 ⌋, ⌊n − nα 3 ⌋ − ⌊ nα 3 ⌋, ⌊ nα 3 ⌋, 0, 0, 0, 0].\nThe dominant corner points of the polytope with respect to the set of Inequalities in theorem 1 are of three different types. The ﬁrst type comprises those rate tuples which do not have any excessive rate for opportunistic decoding, when the transmitter is not active. The achievable scheme for these points is the same as that of X channel which is based on interference alignment [8]. These rate tuples play a funda- mental role in contributing to maximizing the throughput. The rate tuples of the second type are those which do not have any rate to be transmitted in the X channel scenario. These rate tuples can be trivially achieved. The third class is the set of rate tuples for which the total rate is shared between the two different scenarios. The achievable scheme for this\nclass is tricky in some cases.The main idea is to exploiting the locations devoted to the interfering signals in the X channel setting to transmit a message opportunistically when the other transmitter is not active.\nAmong these rate tuples, it is observed that the rate tuple v 7 = [n(1 − α), 0, n(1 − α), 0, nα, 0, nα, 0] always maximizes the throughput function regardless of the probability p, when α ∈ [0, 1 2 ].This rate tuple also contributes to maximizing the the throughput in the other regimes, when the probability of activeness of each transmitter is low.\nNote that, given a rate tuple, when the transmission rates through both direct and cross links is the same for each of the transmitter/receiver pairs, the signaling scheme at each of the transmitters, as well as the decoding scheme at each of the receivers, is the same. Thus, in such symmetric cases, we avoid repetition and only sketch the signaling scheme at one of the transmitters, and likewise the decoding scheme at one of the receivers.\nIn order to achieve v 7 , transmitter 1 reserves the ﬁrst n (1 − α) most signiﬁcant bits of X 1 to carry the information bits of the message w X 11 . This is the amount of rate required when both two users are active and is evidently decodable. The remaining nα bits are devoted to w RA 11 which are decoded opportunistically when the other user is not transmitting. At receiver 1, the received n bits always contain n (1 − α) bits which are protected form interference and will be decoded eventually as w X 11 . The remaining nα bits are mixed with the interference and will opportunistically be decoded when the other sender is not active.\nIn the following, we sketch the achievability scheme for the other points which maximize the throughput for higher activity probabilities of the transmitters, for the other regimes in terms of α,.\nWhen α ∈ [ 1 2 , 2 3 ], the other point which maximizes the throughput for higher activeness probabilities of the transmit- ters is v 8 = [nα, 0, nα, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The required signaling scheme to achieve this point is to locating the private and common part of w X 11 , respectively in the ﬁrst n (1 − α) least signiﬁcant bits and ﬁrst n (2α − 1) most signiﬁcant bits of X 1 and setting the remaining bits to zero.\nThe other point which contributes to maximizing the throughput when α ∈ [ 2 3 , 3 4 ] is v 9 = [n(2 − 2α), n(3α − 2), n(2 − 2α), n(3α − 2), 0, 0, 0, 0] which does not require any excessive rate when one of the transmitters is off. In the achievable signaling scheme for this rate tuple, the ﬁrst n (1−α) LSB of X 1 carry the private part of the message w X 11 . The ﬁrst n (1 − α) most signiﬁcant bits carry the common part of w X 11 and the next n (3α − 2) bits right after the common part of w X 11 are devoted to w X 21 . All the remaining bits are set to zero.In this setting, interfering messages (i.e. w X 21 and the common part of w X 22 ) are received aligned in the ﬁrst receiver.\nWhen α is approaching 1, namely α ∈ [ 3 4 , 1], the achiev- able scheme is based on interference alignment (linear pre- coding). The rate tuple v 10 = [⌊n − nα 3 ⌋ − ⌊ nα 3 ⌋, ⌊ nα 3 ⌋, ⌊n −\n⌋ − ⌊ nα 3 ⌋, ⌊ nα 3 ⌋, 0, 0, 0, 0] is the one which maximized the throughput meanwhile provides the maximum sum rate for the X channel. The achievable scheme for this rate tuple is illustrated in the following example for n = 11 and α = 9 11\n(The proof of achievability for this point with another example can be found in [8]). As for the example set the transmission signal X 1 (most signiﬁcant bit in the left hand side) to be\nWe use the same signaling for X 2 . This way, what is received in the receiver 1 is\n[w 11 (1),w 11 (2), w 21 (1) + w 22 (1), w 11 (3) + w 21 (2) + w 22 (2), w 12 (1), w 21 (3) + w 22 (3) + w 12 (2), w 11 (3), w 12 (3),\nAs it can be seen, the information bits w X 11 (i), i ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4} and w X 12 (i), i ∈ {1, 3} can be directly decoded. To decode w X 11 (5), it is enough to decode the bits Y 1 (8) and Y 1 (11) jointly. Joint decoding of Y 1 (7) and Y 1 (9) bits,decodes w X 12 (3) as well.\nAs mentioned earlier, the binary deterministic model repre- sents a ﬁrs-order approximation of the Gaussian channel. We have assumed the maximum conveyable information across this channel is 2n bits per channel use, regardless of which set of transmitters are active. Merging the information theoretic point of view with the networking one, we can interpret the parameter p , so as to represent the burstiness of the data arrivals as well as the probability that each user goes active. Having found the exact characterization of the capacity region for the BD symmetric RAC-X, we are now able to formulate and solve the maximization problem for the throughput. As mentioned earlier, the network throughput can be written as follows:\nwhich is subject to the constraint that all the rates above belong to the capacity region of the binary deterministic ,symmetric RAC-X. It can be easily seen that the optimization of the throughput is a linear programming problem, for each ﬁxed value of p. So, searching among corner points of the rate region guarantees ﬁnding the rate tuple R which maximizes the throughput.As seen in the section II, the dominant corner points of the rate region vary according to the value of α, so we consider four different case for the optimization problem.\n1) 0 ≤ α ≤ 1 2 : It can be seen that the dominant corner point, as far as the maximum throughput is concerned, for small values of α is v 7 , regardless of the value of p. This im- plies that each transmitter should dedicate all of its resources to the desired messages (w 11 and w 22 ) at direct receivers. This leads to the maximum possible decodable rates of the X network, when both senders are active, as well as some excessive rate to be conveyed in the absence of the other transmitter. Therefore, the throughput T is:\n2) 1 2 ≤ α ≤ 2 3 : When p is small, it is more likely that one of the transmitters is not active. In such cases, transmitting all of the bits which contain information from w 11 and w 22 is beneﬁcial. This signaling, when one of the transmitters is not active, obtains a higher rate. However when both of the transmitters go active, it suffers a rate loss penalty. Solving the optimization problem, it can be found out that, for small values of p, the effective signaling scheme is the one which achieves the rate tuple v 7 , while as α increases, the effective signaling is the same as the one used in X-channel, i.e. v 8 . The throughput can be computed as follows:\n3) 2 3 ≤ α ≤ 3 4 : Like the previous case, opportunistic decoding is only available for small values of p. Optimizing the throughput certiﬁes this justiﬁcation; since for the small values of p, the rate tuple v 7 gives the highest throughput. For higher values of p, it can be observed that the optimal rate tuple is v 9 .\nWe can compare this channel with its brother, the 2-user In- terference Channel (IC). It is known that, as interference (cross link strength α) increases, the scheme which achieves the maximum sum rate in the IC is to decode as much interference as possible. In our scenario, it can be seen that, as α increases, it is beneﬁcial to decode the received information over the cross channel (w 12 and w 21 ). Interestingly, the throughput is the same as the case 1 2 ≤ α ≤ 2 3 , however, the achievable scheme is different.\n4) 3 4 ≤ α ≤ 1: Using signal transmission with linear pre- coding makes the X channel preform much better than IC by exploiting the possibility of suppressing the interference using the interference alignment. The optimized signaling which is based on the signal space alignment method is described in details in [8] and [10]. It can be seen that, depending on the value of nα, the decision region between the different rate tuples varies. In this case v 7 is sill the main contributing rate tuple for small values of p. However, the region of contribution for this signaling is shortened as α increases. For greater values of p, the best possible signaling is to using the same scheme as in X channel based on the interference alignment. The optimal rate tuple in this case is v 10 . It can be seen that the sum rate transmittable with this rate tuple when both of transmitters are active is ⌊n − nα 3 ⌋, which is the same as the results of [8].The throughput can be represented as:\nwhere ⌈x⌉ rounds x to the nearest integers greater than or equal to x. Fig 2 shows the normalized throughput ( T 2n ), for different values of α versus the probability p. The black curve represent the optimized throughput, while the green one is the signaling that maximize the sum-rate when both transmitters are active. Finally the red curve represents the opportunistic transmission scheme.\nWe studied the throughput maximization problem for a 2 user symmetric X channel with random access to the common wireless medium from a deterministic point of view. In the optimal signaling scheme, each transmitter, based on the values of p and α, estimates the state of the other transmitter and adjusts its encoding rate accordingly. It is observed, for certain channel gains that interference alignment can improve the performance of the X channel comparing with the 2 user interference channel."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"N.
