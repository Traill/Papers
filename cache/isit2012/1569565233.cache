We demonstrate how a sequential decoding approach can achieve the Holevo limit for both of these settings. A crucial part of our scheme for both settings is a non-destructive \u201cvacuum-or-not\u201d measurement that projects an n-symbol modulated codeword onto the n-fold vacuum state or its orthogonal complement, such that the post-measurement state is either the n-fold vacuum or has the vacuum removed from the support of the n symbols\u2019 joint quantum state. The sequential decoder for optical communication requires the additional ability to perform multimode optical phase-space displacements\u2014realizable using a beamsplitter and a laser, while the sequential decoder for quantum reading also requires the ability to perform phase-shifting (realizable using a phase plate) and online squeezing (a phase-sensitive ampliﬁer)."},"body":{"text":"One of the ﬁrst accomplishments in quantum information theory was the upper bound (now known as the Holevo bound ) on how much classical information can be encoded into a quantum system, such that another party can reliably recover it using a quantum measurement [1]. Subsequently, Holevo, Schumacher, and Westmoreland (HSW) proved that the Holevo bound is also an achievable rate for classical communication over a quantum channel [2], [3], establishing a lower bound on a quantum channel\u2019s classical capacity. These initial results were the impetus for the ﬁeld of quantum information theory [4], a generalization of Shannon\u2019s classi- cal information theory that takes into account the quantum- physical nature of the carrier of information, channel, and the receiver measurement. The main accomplishment of HSW was to provide a mathematical speciﬁcation of a decoding measurement that a receiver, bound only by the laws of quantum mechanics, could perform on the output codeword to recover the classical data transmitted by a sender at any rate below the Holevo limit. The HSW decoder prescription in general leads to a collective measurement on the codeword\u2019s joint quantum state, which may not be doable by detecting each individual symbol of the codeword separately.\nFor the single-mode lossy bosonic channel\u2014which can be used to construct a wide class of practical free-space and ﬁber optical channels\u2014it was shown that the single-letter Holevo\nbits per channel use, where N S is the mean transmitted photon number per channel use, and η ∈ (0, 1] is the input-output power transmissivity. Furthermore, conventional laser-light (coherent-state) modulation with symbols chosen i.i.d. from an isotropic Gaussian prior distribution, can achieve this capacity (i.e., it is not necessary to use exotic non-classical states, such as squeezed or entangled states). The lossy bosonic channel preserves a coherent state (|α → | √ ηα ), thus preserving its purity. The average output state is a zero-mean circularly- symmetric Gaussian mixture of coherent states, which is a thermal state with mean photon number ηN S , which saturates the entropy bound g (ηN S ). A converse proof shows that no other choice of modulation states and/or priors can exceed this capacity [5]. This result enabled comparing the ultimate channel capacity with the ideal Shannon limits of the classical channels induced by the quantum noise-characteristics of standard optical receivers, such as homodyne, heterodyne and direct detection receivers [5]. In spite of this accomplishment, it remains unclear how one could construct an implementation of the HSW decoding measurement for the bosonic channel using known optical components.\nThe theory of HSW also applies in the setting of \u201cquantum reading\u201d [6], where one can obtain a quantum advantage in the rate of read out of classical information stored in a digital memory. Classical bits are encoded into the reﬂectivity and phase of memory cells. A transmitter irradiates the memory with light that in turn is modulated by a passive linear reﬂection from the memory cells (each cell is a single-mode lossy bosonic channel, but this time information is encoded in the memory cell\u2019s transmissivity and phase). A mono- static receiver gathers the reﬂected light for measurement and processing. The above is a bare-bone model for optical disks such as CDs or DVDs. Pirandola originally considered this task in the context of quantum channel discrimination and demonstrated a quantum advantage. He and his collaborators later considered a coded strategy (in the information-theoretic sense) [7]. Later work [8], [9] improved upon Ref. [7], by demonstrating how to achieve the Holevo limit g (N S ) bits/cell, where N S is the mean number of photons available at\nthe transmitter to shine on each memory cell on an average. It turns out however, that the strategy for achieving g (N S ) is different from that of the lossy bosonic channel, and surprisingly, a coherent-state probe fails to achieve the Holevo capacity [8], [9]. The classical information is encoded into the phase of the cells (with each having perfect reﬂectivity). The symbols of the phase code are chosen i.i.d. and uniformly at random from the interval [0, 2π). The transmitter shines each cell with the single-mode quantum superposition state:\nand the receiver performs a collective measurement on the received codeword (|n is a photon number state [10]). The average state of the received ensemble is a completely de- phased version of |φ II , yet again, a thermal state with mean photon number N S , which saturates the entropy bound g (N S ). Again, the authors of Ref. [8] left open the question of a structured capacity-achieving receiver measurement.\nIn this paper, we address the open questions from Refs. [5], [8], [9], by detailing a structured quantum measurement that can achieve both of the above Holevo limits (for optical communication and quantum reading). The measurement is a sequential decoder, in the sense that it is a sequence of binary- outcome measurements that ask, \u201cWas the received quantum state produced from the ﬁrst codeword? the second codeword? the third?\u201d etc., proceeding until the answer to one of the questions is \u201cyes.\u201d Our work builds on recent insights of Giovannetti et al. [11] and Sen [12] in sequential decoding for quantum channels. Our primary contribution here is to show how to construct these measurements in an optical setting.\nOur sequential decoding scheme for the lossy bosonic channel requires two capabilities at the receiver. First, the receiver should be able to apply a \u201cdisplacement operator,\u201d which simply requires highly reﬂective beamsplitters and a strong laser local oscillator [13]. Second, the receiver should be able to perform a quantum non-demolition measurement to determine whether an n-mode state is in the vacuum state or not. That is, the measurement operators are of the form {|0 0| ⊗n , I ⊗n − |0 0| ⊗n }, where |0 is the vacuum state and I is the identity operator. After performing such a measurement on an n-mode state |ψ , the post-measurement state should be either |0 ⊗n or (|ψ − c |0 ⊗n )/ 1 − |c| 2 , with c = 0| ⊗n |ψ . The key aspect of this measurement is that its disturbance to an n-mode state becomes asymptotically negligible as n becomes large, as long as the number of code- words is no larger than ∼ 2 ng(ηN S ) . Our sequential decoding scheme for quantum reading requires the \u201cvacuum-or-not\u201d measurement described above, and the ability to perform phase shifting and online squeezing [10].\nWe structure this paper as follows. Section I reviews stan- dard deﬁnitions and notation that are helpful for understanding the rest of the paper. Section II describes how a sequen- tial decoder operates when decoding classical information transmitted over a pure-state classical-quantum channel, and for completeness, App. B of Ref. [14] provides a proof\nthat this scheme achieves the Holevo capacity. Section III provides a summary of the operations needed for sequential decoding of the lossy bosonic channel. Section IV details an implementation of a sequential decoder for quantum reading. We conclude in Section V with a summary and a list of open questions.\nWe denote quantum systems as A, B, and C and their corresponding Hilbert spaces as H A , H B , and H C with respective dimensions d A , d B , and d C . We denote pure states of the system A with a ket |φ A and the corresponding density operator as φ A = |φ φ| A . All kets that are quantum states have unit norm, and all density operators are positive semi- deﬁnite with unit trace. We model our lack of access to a quantum system with the partial trace operation. That is, given a two-qubit state ρ AB shared between Alice and Bob, we can describe Alice\u2019s state with the reduced density operator: ρ A =Tr B ρ AB , where Tr B denotes a partial trace over Bob\u2019s system. Let H(A) ρ ≡ −Tr ρ A log ρ A be the von Neumann entropy of the state ρ A .\nIn this section, we describe the operation of a sequential decoder that can reliably recover classical information encoded into a pure state ensemble. App. B of Ref. [14] contains a full error analysis, demonstrating that the scheme achieves capacity.\nSuppose that a classical-quantum channel of the form x → |φ x connects a sender Alice to a receiver Bob. For our purposes here, it does not matter whether the classical input x is discrete or continuous.\nTheorem 1: Let x → |φ x be a classical-quantum channel and let ρ ≡ x p X (x) |φ x φ x | for some distribution p X (x). Then the rate H (ρ) bits per channel use is achievable for com- munication over this channel by having the receiver employ a sequential decoding strategy.\nCodebook Construction. Before communication begins, Alice and Bob agree upon a codebook. We allow them to select a codebook randomly according to the distribution p X (x). So, for every message m ∈ M ≡ 1, . . . , 2 nR , generate a codeword x n (m) ≡ x 1 (m) · · · x n (m) randomly and independently according to\nSequential Decoding. Transmitting the codeword x n (m) through n uses of the channel x → |φ x leads to the following quantum state at Bob\u2019s output:\nUpon receiving the quantum codeword φ x n (m) , Bob per- forms a sequence of binary-outcome quantum measure- ments to determine the classical codeword x n (m) that Al- ice transmitted. He ﬁrst \u201casks,\u201d \u201cIs it the ﬁrst codeword?\u201d\nby performing the measurement { φ x n (1) φ x n (1) , I ⊗n − φ x n (1) φ x n (1) }. If he receives the outcome \u201cyes,\u201d then\nhe performs no further measurements and concludes that Alice transmitted the codeword x n (1). If he receives the outcome \u201cno,\u201d then he performs the measurement { φ x n (2) φ x n (2) , I ⊗n − φ x n (2) φ x n (2) } to check if Alice sent the second codeword. Similarly, he stops if he receives \u201cyes,\u201d and otherwise, he proceeds along similar lines.\nThe above concludes the description of the operation of the sequential decoder. We provide an error analysis demonstrat- ing that this scheme works well in App. B of Ref. [14], i.e., the word error goes to zero as n → ∞, as long as R < H(ρ). Note that Sen [12] and Giovannetti et al. [11] already gave a proof that a sequential decoder works, but our proof in App. B of Ref. [14] is a bit simpler because it is specialized to the case of pure-state ensembles (which is sufﬁcient to consider for our settings of pure-loss optical communication and quantum reading).\nWe now provide a physical realization of the sequential decoding strategy in the context of optical communications. In this setting, we suppose that a lossy bosonic channel, speciﬁed by the following Heisenberg relations, connects Alice to Bob:\nwhere ˆ a, ˆ b, and ˆ e are the respective ﬁeld operators for Alice\u2019s input mode, Bob\u2019s output mode, and an environmental input mode (assumed to be in its vacuum state). The transmissivity η ∈ [0, 1] is the fraction of Alice\u2019s input photons that make it to Bob on average. We assume that Alice is constrained to using mean photon number N S per channel use.\nThe strategy for achieving the classical capacity of this channel is for Alice to induce a classical-quantum channel, by selecting α ∈ C and preparing a coherent state |α [10] at the input of the channel in (3). The resulting induced classical- quantum channel to Bob is of the following form:\nBy choosing the distribution p X (x) in Theorem 1 to be an isotropic, complex Gaussian with variance N S :\nwe have that g (ηN S ) is an achievable rate for classical communication. The quantity g (ηN S ) is the entropy of the average state of the ensemble {p N S (α) , |\nwhich is a thermal state with mean photon number ηN S [10]. Each quantum codeword selected from the ensemble\nWe assume η = 1 above and for the rest of this section without loss of generality. Thus, the sequential decoder consists of measurements of the following form for all m ∈ M:\nwhere D (α) ≡ exp αˆ a \u2020 − α ∗ ˆ a is the well-known unitary \u201cdisplacement\u201d operator from quantum optics [10] and |0 ⊗n is the n-fold tensor product vacuum state, it is clear that the decoder can implement the measurement in (4) in three steps:\nby employing highly asymmetric beam-splitters with a strong local oscillator [13].\n2) Perform a \u201cvacuum-or-not\u201d measurement of the form |0 0| ⊗n , I ⊗n − |0 0| ⊗n .\nIf the vacuum outcome occurs, decode as the m th codeword. Otherwise, proceed.\n3) Displace by D (α 1 (m)) ⊗ · · · ⊗ D (α n (m)) with the same method as in Step 1.\nThe receiver just iterates this strategy for every codeword in the codebook, and Theorem 1 states this strategy is capacity- achieving.\nRemark 2: The above strategy is reminiscent of the class of conditional pulse nulling receivers [15], which are useful in discriminating M -ary pulse-position-modulation coded states with |α in the i th slot and vacuum states |0 in the other M −1 slots. In this strategy, the receiver hypothesizes at ﬁrst that the transmitted codeword is the ﬁrst codeword |α |0 ⊗M −1 , nulls the ﬁrst mode by applying D \u2020 (α), and direct-detects the ﬁrst mode. If the sender in fact transmitted the ﬁrst codeword, then the resulting state is ideally |0 ⊗m , and direct detection of the ﬁrst mode should ideally produce no \u201cclicks.\u201d If there is no click, then the receiver direct detects the other modes to conﬁrm the original hypothesis. If there are no further clicks, then the receiver declares that the sender transmitted the ﬁrst codeword. If there is a further click, then the receiver guesses the codeword corresponding to the position of the click. If on the ﬁrst mode there is a click, then the receiver hypothesizes that the transmitted codeword is the second one and repeats the above algorithm on the next M − 1 modes.\nThe difference between the sequential decoding strategy and conditional pulse nulling is that the codewords are dif- ferent, and the vacuum-or-not measurement in the sequential decoding strategy is much more difﬁcult to perform in practice than direct detection, which annihilates the detected quantum state. Ideally, the vacuum-or-not should be a non-demolition measurement such that the post-measurement state is |0 ⊗n or (|ψ − c |0 ⊗n )/ 1 − |c| 2 , with c = 0| ⊗n |ψ , if the pre- measurement state is |ψ , with probabilities p 0 = |c| 2 and p 1 = 1 − p 0 , respectively, of the two possible outcomes.\nRemark 3: The crucial (and most difﬁcult) step in sequen- tial decoding for the lossy bosonic channel is the vacuum- or-not measurement. Oi et al. have provided a method for performing this measurement, by interacting the light ﬁeld with a three-level atom in a STIRAP process [16]. This approach would likely be quite lossy in practice, so it would be ideal to determine an all-optical vacuum-or-not measurement.\nRemark 4: If the mean input photon number N S 1, then one does not require a full Gaussian distributed codebook in order to achieve capacity. A simpler method, called binary phase-shift keying, sufﬁces to approach capacity very closely. In this approach, the ensemble for generating a codebook randomly is just {1/2, |±α }. This also simpliﬁes the se- quential decoder because the only displacements required for implementation are D (±α). An additional advantage is that a random linear encoder should achieve the capacity, by an argument similar to that on pages 3-14 and 3-15 of Ref. [17]. BPSK polar codes are capacity-achieving for low- photon number as well [18].\nRemark 5: Tan proved a variation of Theorem 1 for the lossy bosonic channel in her thesis [19], but the analysis in App. B of Ref. [14] demonstrates that it is actually not necessary to perform a measurement onto the average typical subspace. We avoided having to do so by demonstrating that it is sufﬁcient to code for a typical-projected version of the channel and applying Sen\u2019s non-commutative union bound from Ref. [12].\nRemark 6: The above sequential decoding approach also works well in the context of private classical communication over a lossy bosonic channel [20], [21]. The private classical capacity of the channel in (3) is g (ηN S ) − g ((1 − η) N S ) (compare to its public classical capacity of g (ηN S )), and the strategy for encoding is again to choose coherent states randomly according to an isotropic Gaussian prior. The se- quential decoder can just test for all codewords in a codebook of size 2 ng(ηN S ) and recover the transmitted private message correctly. The privacy in the scheme comes about by choos- ing 2 ng((1−η)N S ) codewords corresponding to each message and selecting one of these uniformly at random in order to randomize Eve\u2019s knowledge of the transmitted message [20].\nThe sequential decoding strategy also ﬁnds application in \u201cquantum reading\u201d [6]. In this setting, we suppose that information is encoded into passive memory cells of an optically-readable memory, which a transceiver can read out by irradiating them with laser (or quantum) light and detecting the reﬂected light. More speciﬁcally, we can model the i th optical memory cell as a beamsplitter of the following form:\nwhere the parameters η i and θ i are the respective reﬂectivity and phase of the i th cell, and ˆ a i , ˆ b i , and ˆ e i are the respective ﬁeld operators for the transmitter\u2019s i th input mode, the i th reﬂected mode, and an environmental mode (assumed to be in its vacuum state). We assume perfect channels from the\ntransmitter to the optical memory cells and from the cells back to the receiver (which is co-located with the transmitter).\nThe objective is for the transmitter to interrogate each optical memory cell with some quantum state of light with mean photon number N S . The receiver then collects all of the reﬂected light and performs some measurement to recover the classical information encoded in the memory cells. If we use a coherent-state transmitter to interrogate each cell, we call it the Type I setting [8]. If we do not allow the transmitter to retain any state entangled with the transmitted light, but allow it to send any quantum state (entangled spatially across modes or an unentangled non-classical product state), then this is termed the Type II setting [8]. Finally, if we do allow for entanglement assistance, in the sense that the transmitter can prepare two modes in an entangled state for each of the n memory cells, send one to a memory cell while retaining the other, then this is termed a Type III setting [8]. In each of the three settings, the receiver is always allowed to perform a general (collective) quantum measurement on the reﬂected n modes (and the retained n modes, in case of Type III). It is straightforward to prove that g (N S ) is the Holevo (upper) bound on the capacity of quantum reading in the Type I and Type II settings, while it is unknown whether g (N S ) could be exceeded in the Type III setting [8].\nRecently, Guha et al. proved that the following strategy achieves the g (N S ) bound for quantum reading using a Type II transmitter [8], [9]. The transmitter interrogates each memory cell with a quantum state of light of the form in (2). It is straightforward to compute that the mean number of photons in this state is N S : φ II | ˆ n |φ II = N S , where ˆ n = ˆ a \u2020 ˆ a is the photon number operator [10]. Each memory cell has classical information encoded into only the phase variable θ i (with η i = 1), so that a randomly chosen code in the sense of Theorem 1 is selected from the following ensemble:\nand each θ is selected uniformly at random from the interval [0, 2π). The average state of this code ensemble is\nwhich is a thermal state with mean photon number N S . (The effect of phase-randomizing the state |φ II is simply to de- phase it to a thermal state.) Thus, a random code constructed from the ensemble in (5) along with a sequential decoder saturates the entropy bound g (N S ) because the average state is a thermal state.\nIt is not clear to us at the moment how to imple- ment a sequential decoder for the above Type II strategy. Though, if we allow for a Type III transmitter, the strategy\nis straightforward to specify. First, the transmitter interro- gates each optical memory cell with one mode of a two- mode squeezed vacuum state [10] of the following form: |φ III ≡ ∞ n=0 N n S / (N S + 1) n+1 |n |n , while retaining the other mode. The encoding in the optical memory cells is the same as above, such that the memory cells have classical information encoded only into a uniformly random phase. The code ensemble is then {1/2π, |φ III,θ }, with |φ III,θ deﬁned similarly as in (6). The authors of Ref. [8] showed that this ensemble also saturates the g(N S ) bound. Consider the m th quantum codeword to have the form:\nConsider further that each of the states in the above tensor product can be written as\nwhere P (θ i (m)) = exp{iˆ nθ i (m)} is a phase shifter, S (r) is a two-mode squeezing operator [10] with the squeezing strength r, s.t. N S = sinh 2 r, and |0 ⊗2 is a two-mode vacuum state. This then leads us to specify the m th step of the sequential decoder, which proceeds as follows:\n1) Apply the operator P \u2020 (θ i (m)) ⊗ I by phase-shifting the ﬁrst mode of the i th pair by −θ i (m).\n2) Apply the unsqueezing operator S \u2020 (r). The receiver can accomplish this with a phase-sensitive ampliﬁer.\n3) Perform a \u201cvacuum-or-not\u201d measurement of the same form as in Step 2 in the previous section. If the vacuum outcome occurs, decode as the m th codeword. Other- wise, proceed.\n5) Apply the operator (P (θ i (m)) ⊗ I) by phase-shifting the ﬁrst mode of the i th pair by θ i (m).\nThe receiver again iterates this strategy for all codewords in the codebook, and Theorem 1 states that this strategy is Holevo-capacity-achieving, i.e., it achieves g(N S ) bits/cell.\nRemark 7: At N S \t 1, a binary phase-shift keying code approximately achieves the Holevo limit of g (N S ), i.e., C BPSK (N S ) = H 2 (1 ± e −2N S )/2 . The code ensemble for this case is just {(1/2, |φ III ) , (1/2, |φ III,π )}, and the sequential decoder only needs to have phase shifts of 0 or π. Interestingly enough, with binary phase modulation, even a coherent-state (Type I) transmitter can achieve C BPSK (N S ).\nWe have demonstrated that a sequential decoding strategy achieves the Holevo capacity for optical communication and quantum reading, by building on information-theoretic works on sequential decoding in Refs. [11], [12]. Both schemes employ a \u201cvacuum-or-not\u201d measurement which distinguishes coherently and in a non-demolition way between the vacuum or \u201cnot vacuum,\u201d so that the disturbance on the encoded state is asymptotically negligible for long codewords (as long as the code rate is less than the Holevo limit). For optical commu- nication, the only other operation needed is implementing a\ndisplacement operator, while the sequential quantum reading receiver requires phase shifting and online squeezing.\nThe most important open problems going forward concern making the scheme more practical. In this vein, it might be helpful to realize an all-optical implementation of the \u201cvacuum-or-not\u201d measurement\u2014which could help both on the scalability front, and relative ease of implementation as com- pared to a system that uses atom-light interaction [16]. Also, the sequential decoding scheme given here is impractical from a computational perspective because it requires an exponential number of measurements (there are an exponential number of codewords). It would be better to have a sequential decoder that decodes one bit at a time and would thus require only a linear number of measurements.\nWe thank J. P. Dowling, V. Giovannetti, P. Hayden, L.
