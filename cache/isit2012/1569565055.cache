However, the broadcast nature of wireless medium makes wireless networks susceptible to eavesdropping and hence, secure transmission is a fundamental issue in such networks. This problem has been typically addressed at the application layer in which the transmitted bits are scrambled using a secret key shared between a pair of communication nodes. Shannon [1] laid the early foundations on the fun- damental limit to secrecy systems and has shown that the conditional probability of the cryptogram given a message must be independent of the actual transmitted message to achieve perfect secrecy of communication, while Wyner [2] established a wiretap channel formulation and has shown that the perfect secrecy is achievable when the eavesdropper channel is a degraded version of the legitimate channel. The goal of intrinsically secure networks is to exploit the structure of a underlying broadcast channel to transmit a message reliably to the intended receiver, while minimizing information leakage to the eavesdropper [3], [4].\nIn parallel with the potential beneﬁts of multiple-antenna systems to the achievable communication rate and reliability in wireless channels, the use of multiple antennas has been exten- sively invoked to enhance the communication conﬁdentiality in the physical layer [5]\u2013[8]. The secrecy capacity, achievable\nrates, have been analyzed for eclectic antenna conﬁgurations at the transmitter, receiver, and eavesdropper. In particular, it has been shown that the optimal input covariance matrix that maximizes the achievable secrecy rate is of rank one (i.e., beamforming) for a multiple-input single-output (MISO) case [5]\u2013[8]. Moreover, the on-off power control is the opti- mal policy that maximizes the perfect secrecy rate achieved by beamforming in the direction of the legitimate channel when full channel state information (CSI) of the eavesdropper channel is infeasible at the transmitter [7]. However, the degree of freedom for conﬁdential transmission in this case vanishes due to a single high-SNR degree of freedom for communication by beamforming in both the legitimate and eavesdropper channels [7], [8]. This degree of freedom can be recovered by exploiting the simulated interfering signal or the so-called artiﬁcial noise [9], [10]. For example, by transmitting the information-bearing signal in the direction of the legitimate channel along with the artiﬁcial noise in its null space, the artiﬁcial noise behaves as interference only in the eavesdropper channel to remove the high-SNR communication degree of eavesdropping without interfering on the legitimate link [9], [10]. The power allocation problem between the information signal and artiﬁcial noise was treated to maximize the achievable secrecy rate for the worst-case scenario [10]. 1\nIn this paper, we consider secure communication over a multiple-input single-output Rayleigh-fading channel in the presence of a multiple-antenna eavesdropper\u2014referred to as a multiple-input single-output multiple-eavesdropper (MIS- OME) wiretap channel. More speciﬁcally, we deal with secure beamforming with artiﬁcial noise when the transmitter has access to full CSI of a legitimate channel but only partial statistical CSI of an eavesdropper channel (as in [7], [10] for a practical design). We ﬁrst treat the power allocation problem between the information-bearing signal and artiﬁcial noise to maximize the achievable secrecy rate of the MISOME wiretap channel in the presence of a weak (low-SNR) or strong (high- SNR) eavesdropper (see Theorems 1 and 2). We then develop a near-optimal power allocation strategy in a switched fashion for a general case (see Theorem 3); and derive the ergodic MISOME secrecy rate achieved by secure beamforming with this switched power allocation in closed form (see Theorem 4).\nDue to page constraint, we will only present our main results without proofs.\nNotation: We denote expectation operator as E {·}; Z + , Z ++ , and C denote nonnegative integer number, positive inte- ger numbers, and complex ﬁeld, respectively; ˜ N m,n is m × n complex Gaussian matrix whose entries are i.i.d., circularly symmetric, zero-mean, unit-variance, complex Gaussian; ( ·) \u2020 is conjugate transpose; 2 F 1 (a, b; c; z), E n (z), and ÖÐ (n, λ) denote Gaussian hypergeometric function, exponential integral function of order n, and nth-order Erlang distribution with a hazard rate λ, respectively; and identity matrix is denoted by I.\nWe consider a MISOME wiretap channel, where an n t - antenna transmitter (Alice) sends conﬁdential messages to a legitimate single-antenna receiver (Bob) in the presence of an n e -antenna passive eavesdropper (Eve) that only receives the signal from the transmitter without transmitting any jamming signals to the receiver. The received signals at the receiver and eavesdropper are respectively given by\nwhere Ü Ü Ü ∈ C n t is the transmitted signal satisfying the power constraint E Ü Ü Ü \u2020 Ü Ü Ü = 1; r ∼ ˜ N 1,n t and À À À e ∼ ˜ N n e ,n t are ergodic Rayleigh-fading channel gains from the transmitter to the receiver and eavesdropper, respectively; Þ r ∼ ˜ N 1,1 and\ne ∼ ˜ N n e ,1 are additive white Gaussian noises; and ×ÒÖ r and ×ÒÖ e are the average received SNRs per antenna at the receiver and eavesdropper without employing artiﬁcial noise, respectively. All the random quantities Ü Ü Ü , r , À À À e , Þ r , and Þ Þ Þ e are mutually independent.\nFor conﬁdential communication, the transmitter can use artiﬁcial noise to cause interference to the eavesdropper. In this case, the transmitted signal can be divided into the information-bearing signal and artiﬁcial noise as [9], [10]\nwhere × I ∈ C and × × × A ∼ ˜ N n t −1,1 are the information signal and artiﬁcial noise with E | × I | 2 = E × × × A 2 = 1, respectively; Ù Ù Ù I and Í Í Í A are the n t × 1 beamforming vector and the n t ×(n t − 1) beamforming matrix for the information signal and artiﬁcial noise, respectively; and λ ∈ [0, 1] is the power allocation ﬁgure, i.e., a ratio between the information signal power and total power. In the following, we consider that the transmitter has full CSI only for the legitimate channel and partial CSI for the eavesdropper channel. By partial CSI, we refer to only knowledge of the statistics of CSI. With this assumption, it is reasonable to choose Ù Ù Ù I = \u2020 r / r , i.e., the optimal beamforming vector in the absence of eavesdroppers. To cause no interference to the legitimate receiver, Í Í Í A should be chosen in the null space of \u2020 r . In this case, the received\nsignals at the legitimate receiver and eavesdropper are given by\nmatrix, I ∼ ˜ N n e ,1 and A ∼ ˜ N n e ,n t −1 are statistically independent.\nSimilar to [7], we can achieve the secrecy rate for given r using Gaussian codebooks for secure beamforming transmis- sion as in (6), shown at the bottom of the next page, where\nIn this section, we ﬁrst determine the optimal power allo- cation that maximizes the achievable secrecy rate in (6) for a weak (low-SNR) or strong (high-SNR) eavesdropper. We then develop a switched power allocation strategy that solves (6) in a general case and derive the ergodic secrecy rate with this power allocation.\nThe optimal power allocation that maximizes the achievable secrecy rate Ê s can be found by solving the optimization problem in (6). However, the optimal value λ of λ that maximizes the secrecy rate Ê s is hard to be analytically determined due to the non-convexity of Ê (λ) in (6). In the following, we ﬁrst solve the power allocation problem for a weak or strong eavesdropper, and show how we can extend these results to develop a near-optimal solution in a general case.\n1) Weak Eavesdropper ( ×ÒÖ e 1): In this case, using the following approximation\nand letting Ï ∼ ÖÐ (n e , 1), we can rewrite Ê s in (6) as (8), shown at the bottom of the next page.\nλ ↓ = arg max 0≤λ≤1 Ê ↓ (λ) \t (9) be the optimal value of λ that maximizes the secrecy rate\n↓ (λ) over λ ∈ [0, 1]. Then, the optimal λ ↓ is the on-off power allocation given by\nRemark 1: For a weak (low-SNR) eavesdropper, the trans- mitter should use all the power for conﬁdential signal trans- mission. In this case, it is not necessary to use artiﬁcial noise to interfere with the eavesdropper since thermal noise is enough to disturb the signal reception at the eavesdropper. As a result, the on-off power allocation is optimal [7].\nr , whereas it grows with n e and ×ÒÖ e . As ×ÒÖ r , ×ÒÖ e → 0, we have\n= n e α \t (12) where (a) follows from the fact that lim z→∞ e z E n (z) = 0 for n ∈ Z ++ and (b) follows from the fact that (n − 1) E n (z) = e −z −zE n−1 (z). Intuitively, this property implies that the fre- quency of transmission by the legitimate transmitter increases with ×ÒÖ r . This directly improves the ﬁrst term in (8). However, as n e increases, the eavesdropper link becomes more reliable and naturally the legitimate transmitter attempts to send the information less often.\n2) Strong Eavesdropper ( ×ÒÖ e 1): Using the following approximation\nand letting = \u2020 I A \u2020 A −1 I , we can rewrite Ê s in (6) at high ×ÒÖ r 1 as (14), shown at the bottom of the next page.\nκ = arg max κ≥1 Ê ↑ (κ) \t (15) be the optimal value of κ that maximizes the secrecy rate\n↑ (κ) over κ ∈ [1, ∞). Then, the optimal κ is unique and given by if n e = n t − 1,\nκ = n t , \t (16) and if n e < n t − 1, κ is the solution of\n(17) where\nRemark 3: It follows from Theorem 2 that the optimal value of λ for a strong (high-SNR) eavesdropper is equal to λ ↑ = 1/κ . Note that this optimal value does not depend on\nr and the average SNRs at both receivers. It is only a function of the antenna numbers n t and n e . Therefore, a simple deterministic power allocation is sufﬁcient for achieving the maximal secrecy rate and there is no need to implement any adaptive power allocation for the strong eavesdropper. 3\n3) Switched Strategy: In general, it is infeasible to analyti- cally derive the optimal value of λ due to the non-convexity of the objective function in (6). Therefore, we propose a switched power allocation as described in the following theorem.\nTheorem 3 (Switched Power Allocation): Let ζ ↓↑ (if exists) and ζ ↑ be the values of r 2 such that Ê λ ↑ − Ê (1) = 0 and Ê λ ↑ = 0, respectively. Let\n⎧ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎩\nλ ↑ , if ζ ↑ < r 2 < ζ ↓↑ 0, otherwise\n0, \t otherwise \t (21) where ζ min = min {ζ ↓ , ζ ↑ }.\nThe switching thresholds ζ ↓ , ζ ↑ , and ζ ↓↑ are critical values, which are functions of ×ÒÖ r , ×ÒÖ e , n t , and n e . Let λ \u2020 I I+ a λ A \u2020 A −1 I where a λ = 1−λ n t −1 ×ÒÖ e n t . Then, we can obtain the cumulative distribution function of λ for z ≥ 0 using [11, eq. (11)] as follows:\n(22) Using (22), we obtain ζ ↑ as (23), shown at the bottom of the page, where\nwhose closed-form expression is omitted here. Similarly, we can derive the closed-form solution for ζ ↓↑ as (25), shown at the bottom of the page.\nRemark 4: In Theorem 3, it is obvious that we can get back to Theorem 1 at low ×ÒÖ e or Theorem 2 at high ×ÒÖ e from the deﬁnition of λ s in (19).\nTheorem 4: For ζ ↑ < ζ ↓ < ζ ↓↑ , the ergodic secrecy rate (nats/s/Hz) of MISOME Rayleigh-fading wiretap channels achieved by secure beamforming with artiﬁcial noise for the switched power allocation λ s is given by\n(26) where\n1 t\n1 + tb . (27) Remark 5: For other cases, using (21), we can again derive\nthe closed-form expression for Ê s as a form akin to [7, eq. (16)].\nIn this section, we provide some numerical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the switched power allocation for secure beamforming with artiﬁcial noise to improve the ergodic secrecy rate.\nFig. 1 shows the power allocation ﬁgures λ for the switched and optimal power allocations as a function of ×ÒÖ r when\ns is determined by Theorem 3, whereas the optimal power allocation λ is\nfound directly from (6) by using the numerical method. We can see that λ for the weak (low-SNR) or strong (high-SNR) eavesdropper converges to λ s as stated in Theorems 1 and 2, respectively. Hence, we can use the switched power allocation in practical design for simplifying the computational complex- ity while the ergodic secrecy rate remains near-optimally.\nFig. 2 shows the ergodic secrecy rates Ê s for the switched and optimal power allocations as a function of ×ÒÖ r when n t = 3, n e = 1; n t = 3, n e = 2; and n t = 4, n e = 2 for\ne = ×ÒÖ r . We observe that the ergodic secrecy rate for the switched power allocation is very tight to the optimal secrecy rate over the whole SNR regime, showing that the switched power allocation can be used instead of the optimal power allocation without much losing the secrecy rate.\nIn this paper, we investigated secure beamforming with the artiﬁcial noise in MISOME wiretap channels. We deter- mined the on-off and decisive power allocations between the information-bearing signal and artiﬁcial noise to maximize the achievable secrecy rate for weak (low-SNR) and strong (high-SNR) eavesdropping; developed the near-optimal power control regulated in a switched fashion for the general eaves- dropping case; and derived the ergodic MISOME secrecy rate achieved by secure beamforming with the switched power policy.\nThis work was supported by the Korea Research Founda- tion(KRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MEST) (No. 2011-0018071 and No. 2011-0001274)."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"C.
