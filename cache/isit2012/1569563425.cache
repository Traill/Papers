With wide deployment of wireless networks, security issues have recently gained additional importance, including information-theoretic approach at the physical layer [2]. The physical-layer security in MIMO systems has been recently under active investiga- tion [3]-[10]. It was demonstrated that Gaussian signaling is optimal over the wire-tap Gaussian MIMO channels [6]-[10] and the optimal transmit covariance has been found for MISO systems [3] or in the 2-2-1 system [7] under the total power constraint and in the general MIMO case under the transmit covariance matrix constraint [5]. The high-SNR regime (SNR → ∞) has been studied in [9]. The general case is still an open problem under the total power constraint, since the underlying optimization problem is not convex and explicit solutions are not known, except for some special cases. The main contribution of this paper is an explicit, closed-form solution for the optimal full-rank covariance under the total power constraint at ﬁnite SNR (Theorem 2). Theorem 1 sets the foundation for this giving a direct proof (via the necessary KKT conditions) to a necessary condition of optimality, which is a transmission of the positive directions of the difference channel. The cases of high-SNR and of weak eavesdropper are elaborated in Corollaries 3 and 4. The optimal covariance of Theorem 2 is shown to have some properties similar to those of the conventional water-ﬁlling, but with a few remarkable differences. In particular, the optimal covariance does not converge to a scaled identity in the high-SNR case and thus isotropic signaling is sub-optimal in this regime. Proposition 1 shows that a transmission on the positive eigenspace of the difference channel satisﬁes the necessary condition and\nis a convex optimization problem (so that all powerful tools of convex optimization apply [11]). Corollary 1 reﬁnes the estimate of the optimal covariance matrix rank given in [10] for the general case.\nLet us consider the standard wire-tap Gaussian MIMO channel model,\nwhere x = [x 1 , x 2 , ...x m ] T ∈ C m,1 is the transmitted complex-valued signal vector of dimension m×1, \u201cT\u201d denotes transposition, y 1(2) ∈ C n,1 are the received vectors at the receiver (eavesdropper), ξ 1(2) is the circularly-symmetric ad- ditive white Gaussian noise at the receiver (eavesdropper) (nor- malized to unit variance in each dimension), H 1(2) ∈ C n 1(2) ,m is the n 1(2) × m matrix of the complex channel gains between each Tx and each receive (eavesdropper) antenna, n 1(2) and m are the numbers of Rx (eavesdropper) and Tx antennas respectively. The channels H 1(2) are assumed to be quasistatic (i.e., constant for a sufﬁciently long period of time so that the inﬁnite horizon information theory assumption holds) and frequency-ﬂat, with full channel state information (CSI) at the Rx and Tx ends.\nFor a given transmit covariance matrix R = E {xx + }, where E {·} is statistical expectation, the maximum achievable secure rate between the Tx and Rx (so that the rate between the Tx and eavesdropper is zero) is [5]-[10]\nwhere negative C(R) is interpreted as zero rate, W i = H + i H i , () + means Hermitian conjugation, and the secrecy capacity subject to the total Tx power constraint is\nwhere P T is the total transmit power (also the SNR since the noise is normalized). It is well-known that the problem in (3) is not convex in general and explicit solutions for the optimal Tx covariance are not known except for some special cases (e.g. low-SNR or MISO channels). It was conjectured in [10] that an optimal transmission in (3) is on the directions where the main channel is stronger than the eavesdropper one (i.e. on the positive directions of the difference channel W 1 − W 2 ). A similar conclusion, albeit in a different (indirect) form, has been obtained in [9] using the degraded channel approach. Theorem 1 below gives a direct formulation and proof of this fact using the necessary KKT conditions, which is also\ninstrumental for further development. In particular, Theorem 2 gives an explicit, closed-form solution for the optimal full- rank covariance in (3) at ﬁnite SNR. A number of additional insights follow.\nThe following Theorem gives a necessary condition of the optimality in (3).\nand let u i+ be its active eigenvector (i.e. corresponding to a positive eigenvalue). Then,\ni.e. a necessary condition for an optimal signaling strategy in (3) is to transit over the positive directions of W 1 −W 2 (where the legitimate channel is stronger than the eavesdropper) 1 .\nIt was demonstrated in [10] that rank(R ∗ ) < m unless W 1 > W 2 2 , i.e. an optimal transmission is of low-rank over a non-degraded channel. The Corollary below gives more precise characterization.\nCorollary 1: Let W 1 − W 2 = W + + W − , where W +(−) collects positive (negative and zero) eigenmodes of W 1 − W 2 (found from its eigenvalue decomposition). Then, rank(R ∗ ) ≤ rank(W + ) ≤ m, i.e. the rank of an optimal covariance R ∗ does not exceed the number of positive eigen- values of W 1 − W 2 (the rank of W + ).\nProof: follows from (4) using the fact that the eigenvectors u i+ are orthogonal to each other.\nWhen rank(W + ) = 1, the optimal covariance R ∗ and capacity follow from Corollary 1 3 :\nwhere λ 1 , u 1 are the largest eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector of (I+P T W 2 ) −1 (I+P T W 1 ) or, equivalently, the largest generalized eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector of (I + P T W 1 , I + P T W 2 ), so that transmit beamforming on u 1 is the optimal strategy. Note that this result is more general than those in [3][7] as the latter two apply to a single antenna channel (either at the receiver or eavesdropper) while the result above holds for any number of antennas at any end. Furthermore, the signaling at (5) is also optimal for any rank(W + ) ≥ 1 at low SNR, where λ 1 , u 1 become the largest eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector of W 1 − W 2 .\nOne way to achieve the necessary condition in (4) is to transmit over the positive eigenspace of W 1 − W 2 , as the following Proposition shows.\nProposition 1: The following covariance matrix satisﬁes the necessary condition of Theorem 1:\nand W i+ = P + W i P + , P + = U + U + + is the projection matrix on the positive eigenspace of W 1 − W 2 , U + is a semi-unitary matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of W 1 − W 2 corresponding to its positive eigenvalues: W + = U + D + U + + > 0, and D + is the diagonal matrix of the positive eigenvalues. The optimal (maximizing) covariance R \u2032 in (5) satisﬁes\nwhere {v i+ (R) } denotes a set of eigenvectors corresponding to positive eigenvalues of matrix R.\nIt follows from (6) that the transmission takes places on the projected channels W i+ = P + W i P + . It should be noted that the eigenvectors of the optimal covariance R \u2032 in (5) are not necessarily the same as those of W + . Rather, they span the same sub-space. In one special case, R \u2032 and W + do have the same eigenvectors.\nCorollary 2: Consider the secure MIMO channel in (1) such that rank(W + ) = 1. Then\nwhere u + is the only active eigenvector of W + (corresponding to a positive eigenvalue), i.e. the optimal transmission is unique and on the positive eigenvector of W + with the full available power.\nThe problem in (6) has further signiﬁcance: while the problem C s = max R ≥0 C(R) is not convex, so that powerful tools of convex optimization [11] cannot be used, the problem max R ≥0 C + (R) is convex, to which all machinery of convex optimization can be applied. The following proposition makes this precise.\nProposition 2: C + (R) is a non-negative, concave and non-decreasing function of R (strictly positive, concave and increasing when the active eigenmodes of R are in the span of the active eigenmodes of W + ).\nIt follows from Proposition 2 that transmission with the full available power is optimal: trR \u2032 = P T .\nLet us now consider the original problem in (3) and obtain its solution R ∗ when the latter is of full rank.\nTheorem 2: Consider the case of W 1 > W 2 > 0 (a degraded full-rank channel) and P T > P T 0 , where P T 0 is a certain threshold power (i.e. sufﬁciently high but ﬁnite SNR). Then, R ∗ is of full rank and is given by:\nwhere the columns of the unitary matrix U are the eigenvectors of W −1 2 − W −1 1 > 0, Λ 1 = diag{λ 1i } > 0 is a diagonal positive-deﬁnite matrix, where\nand µ i > 0 are the eigenvalues of W −1 2 − W −1 1 ; λ > 0 is found from the total power constraint trR ∗ = P T as a unique solution of the following equation:\nwhere Λ 2 = Λ 1 + diag{µ i }. P T 0 can be found as a unique solution of the following equation:\nwhere λ 1min = min i {λ 1i } and λ min (W 1 ) is the minimum eigenvalue of W 1 .\nIt should be pointed out that Theorem 2 gives an exact (not approximate) optimal covariance at ﬁnite SNR (no P T → ∞) since P T 0 is a ﬁnite constant that depends only on W 1 and W 2 and can be found numerically (in fact, it can be not high at all, depending on W 1 and W 2 ). Corollary 4 below makes a more concrete statement. 1st term in (13) C ∞ = ln |W 1 | |W 2 | is SNR-independent and the 2nd one ∆C = ln |Λ 1 | |Λ 2 | < 0 monotonically increases with the SNR. Furthermore, C s → C ∞ , ∆C → 0 as P T → ∞, in agreement with Theorem 2 in [9].\nNote also that the second term in (10) de-emphasizes weak eigenmodes of W 1 . Since λ is monotonically decreasing as P T increases (this follows from (12)), λ 1i monotonically increases with P T , and approaches λ 1i ≈ µ i /λ at sufﬁciently high SNR, which is in contrast with the conventional water-ﬁlling (WF), where the uniform power allocation is optimal at high SNR. Furthermore, it follows from (11) that λ 1i increases with µ i , i.e. stronger eigenmodes of W −1 2 − W −1 1 (which correspond to larger eigenmodes of W 1 and weaker ones of W 2 ) receive larger power allocation, which follows the same tendency as the conventional WF. It further follows from (9) that when W 1 and W 2 have the same eigenvectors, R ∗ also has the same eigenvectors, i.e. the optimal signaling is on the eigenvectors of W 1(2) . While the necessary condition for full- rank R ∗ (W 1 > W 2 ) has been obtained before in [10], no solution was found for R ∗ , which is given in Theorem 2 here. The condition W 2 > 0 can be further removed via a limiting transition W 2ǫ = W 2 + ǫI → W 2 as ǫ → 0 + . The case of singular W 1 can also be included by observing that R ∗ puts no power on the null space of W 1 so that all matrices can be projected, without loss of generality, on the positive eigenspace of W 1 and Theorem 2 will apply. With this in\nmind, the conditions of Theorem 2 are both sufﬁcient and necessary for an optimal covariance to be of full-rank.\nIt is instructive to consider the case when the required chan- nel is much stronger than the eavesdropper one, W 1 ≫ W 2 , meaning that all eigenvalues of W 1 are much larger those of W 2 .\nCorollary 3: Consider the secure MIMO channel in (1) under the conditions of Theorem 2 and when the eavesdropper channel is much weaker than the required one,\nwhere λ i (W 2 ) is i-th eigenvalue of W 2 , e.g. when W 2 → 0 and ﬁxed W 1 . Then the optimal covariance in (10) becomes\nwhere W 1 = U 1 D 1 U + 1 is the eigenvalue decomposition, so that the columns of U 1 are the eigenvectors, and the diagonal entries of D 1 are the eigenvalues.\nAn interpretation of (15) is immediate: the ﬁrst term is the standard water-ﬁlling on the eigenmodes of W 1 (which is the capacity-achieving strategy for the regular MIMO channel) and the second term is a correction due to the secrecy requirement: those modes that spill over into the eavesdropper channel get less power to accommodate the secrecy require- ment.\nCorollary 4: The optimal covariance R ∗ in (10) in the high- SNR regime\nProof: follows from Theorem 2 along the same lines as that of Corollary 3.\nNote that the optimal signaling is on the eigenmodes of W −1 2 − W −1 1 with the optimal power allocation given by {d i }. This somewhat resembles the conventional water-ﬁlling, but also has a remarkable difference: unlike the conventional WF, the secure WF in (17) does not converge to the uniform one in the high-SNR regime 4 . However, strong eigenmodes of W −1 2 − W −1 1 (which corresponds to weak modes of W 2 and strong ones of W 1 ) do get more power, albeit in a form different from that of the conventional WF.\nOptimal signalling over the wire-tap Gaussian MIMO chan- nel has been studied under the total power constraint. Based on the necessary condition of the optimality, an explicit, closed- form solution is given for the optimal transmit covariance when the latter is of full rank. While the optimal signalling has some similarities to the conventional water-ﬁlling, it also reveals a number of differences: the optimal signalling does not converge to isotropic at high SNR. The weak eavesdropper and high-SNR regimes were considered, and a reﬁned estimate of the rank of the optimal covariance matrix is given for the general case.\nProof of Theorem 1: Using Lagrange multiplier technique [11][12], the optimization problem in (3) has the following Lagrangian:\n(19) where λ ≥ 0 is a Lagrange multiplier responsible for the power constraint trR ≤ P T and M ≥ 0 is a (positive semi-deﬁnite) matrix Lagrange multiplier responsible for the constraint R ≥ 0. The associated KKT conditions (see e.g. [11]) can be expressed as:\nMR = 0, λ(trR − P T ) = 0, \t (21) R ≥ 0, M ≥ 0, λ ≥ 0, trR ≤ P T\n(22) and the two equalities in (21) are the complementary slackness conditions. Since the original problem is not convex, the KKT conditions are not sufﬁcient for optimality [11]. However, since the (afﬁne) constraints trR ≤ P T , R ≥ 0 clearly satisfy the Slater condition [11][12] and since the maximum is achievable (since the constraint set is compact and the objective function is continuous), the KKT conditions are necessary for optimality [12]. We further need the following technical Lemma.\nLemma 1: Let A , B, C ≥ 0 be positive semi-deﬁnite matrices and let ABC be Hermitian. Then ABC ≥ 0.\nProof: Since A , C ≥ 0, there exists a non-singular matrix S such that SAS + = D a ≥ 0, SCS + = D c ≥ 0 are diagonal [13]. Using the latter,\nNote that this Lemma is a generalization of a well known fact: AB ≥ 0 if A, B ≥ 0 and AB is Hermitian [13]. We further prove that Z = (I + W 1 R )(I + RW 2 ) > 0 when R > 0; the case of singular R will follow from the standard continuity argument [13]. Assuming R > 0,\nNow identify the right-hand side of (23) with A , B, C and use Lemma 1 to obtain Z ≥ 0 (noting that Z is Hermitian from (20)). Therefore, it follows from (20) that W 1 − W 2 + M ≥ 0 (since λ > 0, as λ = 0 implies W 1 ≤ W 2 and thus C s = 0 - trivial case not considered here). Since |(I + W 1 R )(I + RW 2 )| > 0, it further follows that Z > 0 and W 1 −W 2 +M > 0. Now, let u i+ be an active eigenvector (corresponding to a positive eigenvalue) of R ∗ . Then,\n0 < u + i+ (W 1 − W 2 + M)u i+ = u + i+ (W 1 − W 2 )u i+ where the equality follows from MR = 0. Q.E.D.\nWith more efforts, a stronger statement can be proved: U + r+ (W 1 − W 2 )U r+ > 0\nwhere the columns of U r+ are {u i+ }. Proof of Proposition 1: Notice that\nwhere R + = P + RP + is the projected covariance. Any component of R eliminated by the projection will not af- fect C + (R) but can possibly increase the total power, since trR + ≤ trR. Therefore, the optimal covariance R \u2032 in (6) has to satisfy\n(25) (in which case trR + = trR) and thus clearly satisﬁes (4). Q.E.D.\nProof of Proposition 2: We will need the following tech- nical Lemma.\nwhere A , B, X ≥ 0 are positive semi-deﬁnite matrices, I is the identity matrix, BA −1 B ≤ I. It has the following properties:\nProof: 1st property follows from the (easy to verify) fact that −B(A+X) −1 B is increasing in X (in the matrix positive deﬁnite ordering sense [13]). 2nd one is obtained from the following chain argument:\nwhere A i = A + X i ; (a) follows from the facts that F (X) = X −1 is convex in X and F (X) = ln |X| is increasing [11][13]; (b) follows from the fact that F (X) = ln |X| is concave [11]. Q.E.D.\nWe now assume that W 2+ > 0. The case of singular W 2+ will follow from the standard continuity argument [13]. Observe that\nwhere c = ln |W 1+ | − ln |W 2+ | and ∆W = W −1 2+ − W −1 1+ , and apply Lemma 2 to the last term of the last expres- sion in (27). It is easy to verify that BA −1 B ≤ I (since W −1 2+ −W −1 1+ ≤ W −1 2+ ) and that B ≥ 0 (since W 1+ ≥ W 2+ ). Proposition 2 follows. Q.E.D.\nProof of Theorem 2: It follows from Proposition 2 that C(R) is concave when W 1 > W 2 (no need for projection) so that the problem in (3) is convex and thus the KKT conditions\nare sufﬁcient for optimality. Assuming R > 0 and using M = 0 (which follows from MR = 0), one obtains from (22),\nwhere R i = W −1 i + R, i = 1, 2. Let R 1 = UΛ 1 U + be the eigenvalue decomposition, where the columns of unitary matrix U are the eigenvectors, and Λ 1 > 0 is a diago- nal matrix of the corresponding eigenvalues. Using this in (28), one obtains Λ −1 1 − (U + R 2 U ) −1 = λI and therefore U + R 2 U = Λ 2 is diagonal, so that R 2 = UΛ 2 U + is the eigenvalue decomposition of R 2 , from which it follows that R 1 and R 2 have the same eigenvectors. Using this in (28) one obtains\nso that the columns of U are also the eigenvectors of W −1 2 −W −1 1 and the diagonal entries of Λ 2 −Λ 1 = diag{µ i } are its eigenvalues. Combining the latter with (29), one obtains after some manipulations (11). (10) follows from R 1 = W −1 1 + R and R 1 = UΛ 1 U + . It is straightforward to see that λ > 0 (otherwise W 1 ≤ W 2 ), so that transmission with the full power is optimal and (12) follows from the power constraint trR = P T . For (10) to be a valid solution, we need UΛ 1 U + > W −1 1 . This is insured by observing that the left-hand side of (12) is monotonically decreasing in λ, so that the latter is monotonically decreasing as P T increases and, from (11), λ 1i also monotonically increases. Therefore, for sufﬁciently large P T , P T > P T 0 for some ﬁnite P T 0 , the minimum eigenvalue of Λ 1 exceeds the maximum one of W −1 1 and thus the condition UΛ 1 U + > W −1 1\nfollows. Therefore, (10)-(12) solve the KKT conditions and thus achieve the global optimum. It can be further seen that the solution is unique. Q.E.D.\nwhen x ≪ 1 in (11), one obtains λ 1i ≈ λ −1 + (λ 2 µ i ) −1 , and using this in (12), one obtains λ ≈ m(P T + trW −1 1 ) −1 . The condition x ≪ 1 is equivalent to λµ i ≫ 4, which in turn is equivalent to (14), and the latter also implies min i λ i (W 1 ) ≫ max i λ i (W 2 ) (i.e. the eavesdropper channel is indeed much weaker than the main one), from which it follows that W −1 2 − W −1 1 ≈ W −1 2 , and applying these in (10), one obtains (15).
