Minimum energy per bit and wideband slope expressions are determined to quantify the energy efﬁciency in the low signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR ) regime. In particular, the impact of channel and source variations is investigated. A block-fading model in which fading coefﬁcients are arbitrarily correlated in one block before assuming independent realizations in the next one, is considered. Initially, the effect of fading correlation on energy efﬁciency is analyzed. It is shown that while minimum energy per bit does not depend on the fading correlation, wideband slope decreases as positive correlation increases, resulting in increased energy requirements at low but nonzero SNR levels. Subsequently, an ON-OFF source arrival model is considered. It is shown that while the minimum energy per bit does not get affected by source variations, wideband slope diminishes with increasing source burstiness.

Fundamental limits on the energy efﬁciency of data transmission has been studied in [1] from an information- theoretic perspective. In particular, in this work, the tradeoff between spectral efﬁciency and energy per bit is analyzed in the wideband regime. The minimum energy required to send one bit of information reliably is identiﬁed for a general class of channels. Moreover, wideband slope is introduced as a tool to investigate the performance at low but nonzero SNR levels.\nIn addition to energy efﬁciency, another important consid- eration in wireless systems is to provide quality of service (QoS) guarantees. For instance, wireless multimedia transmis- sions, such as video streaming and interactive video, require certain delay/buffer constraints to be satisﬁed in order to attain acceptable performance levels. In [2] and [3], effective bandwidth and effective capacity formulations are provided as performance metrics to determine the maximum throughput in the presence of statistical QoS constraints in the form of limitations on buffer violation probability. Making use of these tools from stochastic network calculus (see also e.g., [4] and [5]) and the information- theoretic arguments, we have recently addressed energy efﬁciency in fading channels under QoS constraints in [7]. However, we had\ntwo simplifying assumptions in this work. We assumed that the arrival rate was constant, and considered a block-fading model in which the channel fading stayed the same in each block.\nIn this paper, we extend our analysis and address the impact of source and channel variations. In particular, while still assuming block-fading, we allow the fading coefﬁcients to be arbitrarily correlated in each block. Also, we model random arrivals by considering a simple ON-OFF source. We interestingly demon- strate that while channel variations known at the receiver improve the energy efﬁciency under QoS constraints, source variations or burstiness lead to increased energy requirements.\nWe consider a ﬂat-fading channel between the transmitter and receiver. The channel input-output relation can be expressed as\nwhere x i and y i are the channel input and output, respectively. Input is subject to the average energy constraint E{|x i | 2 } ≤ E. n i denotes the zero-mean, circularly-symmetric, complex Gaussian noise with variance E{|n| 2 } = N 0 . Hence, the signal-to-noise ratio is\nAbove in (1), h i denotes the fading coefﬁcient. Fading coefﬁ- cients are assumed to be identically distributed, and the fading distribution can be arbitrary with ﬁnite variance. We consider a block-fading model and assume that the fading changes indepen- dently every m symbols. On the other hand, we assume that in each duration of m symbols, fading can be arbitrarily correlated.\nThe effective capacity formulation provides the maximum constant arrival rate that a given time-varying service process can support while satisfying a QoS requirement speciﬁed by θ [3]. If we deﬁne Q as the stationary queue length, then θ is the decay rate of the tail distribution of the queue length:\nq \t = −θ. \t (3) The above limiting formula implies that for large q max , we have P (Q ≥ q max ) ≈ e −θq max . Hence, when the threshold is\nsufﬁciently large, the buffer violation probability should decay exponentially with rate controlled by the QoS exponent θ. Note that as θ increases, more strict QoS constraints are imposed.\nLet {R[k], k = 1, 2, . . .} denote the discrete-time stationary and ergodic stochastic service process and S[t] \t t k =1 R[k] be the time-accumulated process. Then, the effective capacity is given by [3]\nNote that we have assumed that the fading coefﬁcients {h i } change independently from one block of m symbols to another. Under this assumption, the effective capacity simpliﬁes to\nwhere R is the instantaneous service (or equivalently transmis- sion) rate in a duration of m symbols. If the channel input sequence {x i } is an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sequence of Gaussian random variables with zero mean and variance E, then the service rate can be written as\nIn this paper, we employ energy per bit as the performance metric of energy efﬁciency. In our setup, we deﬁne energy per bit as\nis the normalized version of the effective capacity in (5) in the units of bits/channel use. Hence, C E ( SNR , θ) can be regarded as the spectral efﬁciency under QoS constraints. Note that effec- tive capacity provides a characterization of the arrival process. However, since the average arrival rate is equal to the average departure rate when the queue is in steady-state [6], effective capacity can also be seen as a measure of the transmission rate under buffer constraints.\nIn our analysis, following the approach in [1], we will study the minimum energy per bit and the wideband slope, which is deﬁned as the slope of the spectral efﬁciency curve at zero spectral efﬁciency. While the minimum bit energy is a performance measure in the limit as SNR → 0, wideband slope has emerged as a tool that enables us to analyze the energy efﬁciency at low but nonzero SNR levels.\nunder QoS constraints can be obtained from [1]\n, the slope S 0 of the spectral efﬁciency versus E b /N 0 (in dB) curve is deﬁned as [1]\nConsidering the expression for normalized effective capacity, the wideband slope can be found from\nwhere ˙ C E (0) and ¨ C E (0) are the ﬁrst and second derivatives, respectively, of the function C E ( SNR ) with respect to SNR at zero\nand S 0 provide a linear approximation of the spectral efﬁciency curve at low spectral efﬁciencies.\nIn this section, we assume that the source arrival rate is ﬁxed. As discussed in the previous section, effective capacity, C E ( SNR , θ), characterizes the maximum constant arrival rate in the presence of QoS constraints described by the QoS exponent θ, and can also be seen as the maximum average transmission rate. In the following result, we provide the minimum bit energy and wideband slope expressions under these assumptions.\nTheorem 1: Assume that the source arrival rate is constant. Assume further that the channel fading changes independently every m symbols while the channel fading coefﬁcients are arbitrarily correlated in each duration of m symbols. Then, the minimum energy per bit and wideband slope expressions as a function of the QoS exponent θ are given, respectively, by\nE {z} \t (13) and\n(z i , z j ) = E{z i z j } − E{z i }E{z j } is the covariance of z i and z j .\nProof: As can be seen from (10) and (12), we only need to obtain the ﬁrst and second derivatives of C E ( SNR , θ) with respect to SNR at SNR = 0 to determine the minimum energy per bit and wideband slope. We ﬁrst express the effective capacity given in (9) as\nβ log e 2 log e g( SNR ) \t (15) where we have deﬁned β = θm log\nNow, the ﬁrst and second derivatives of C E ( SNR ) with respect to SNR are easily seen to be given by\ng( SNR ) , and \t (17) ¨ C E ( SNR ) = − 1\nwhere ˙g and ¨ g denote the ﬁrst and second derivatives of the function g with respect to SNR and can be expressed as\nβ m\nlog e 2 \t (21) and\n¨ C E (0) = − β m i =1 m j =1 cov {z i , z j } + m m i =1 E z 2 i m 2 log e 2\nm 2 log e 2 \t . (22) where we have used the facts that m i =1 E {z i } = mE{z} and\nE z 2 i = mE{z 2 } due to our assumption that the fading coefﬁcients and therefore {z i }\u2019s are identically distributed.\nPlugging the expressions in (21) and (22) into those in (10) and (12), we readily obtain the minimum energy per bit and wideband slope expressions in (13) and (14).\nRemark 1: As can be seen in (13), the minimum energy per bit, which is achieved in the asymptotic regime in which SNR vanishes, does not depend on the QoS exponent θ, hence is not affected by the presence of the buffer limitations. Indeed, this is the fundamental limit in Gaussian channels [1].\nRemark 2: Wideband slope S 0 , on the other hand, depends on the QoS constraints through β = θm log\n≥ 0 \t (23) where 1 denotes the m-dimensional column vector of all ones, and z = (z 1 , z 2 , . . . , z m ) T is the column vector of fading magnitude-squares. Hence, E (z − E{z})(z − E{z}) T is the covariance matrix of the random vector z and the inequality in (23) follows from the positive semi-deﬁniteness of this matrix. This observation leads to the conclusion that the presence of QoS limitations (or equivalently having θ > 0) reduces the wideband slope, increasing the energy requirements per bit. Additionally, higher the value of θ, the more strict the QoS constraints are and the smaller the value of the wideband slope is.\nRemark 3: Finally, we discuss the effect of fading correlation. Assume that the fading coefﬁcients are fully correlated and z 1 = z 2 = . . . = z m = z. In this case, we have\n= \t 2(E{z}) 2 (β + 1)E {z 2 } − β(E {z}) 2 . \t (26) The wideband slope expression in (26), which is a special case of (14), was obtained in [7] in which it was assumed that fading was staying constant in each block duration. Note that this is the worst-case scenario. It is well-known through Cauchy-Schwarz inequality that\ncov (z i , z j ) ≤ |cov(z i , z j )| ≤ var (z i )var(z j ) \t (27) = var(z) \t (28)\nwhere (28) follows from our assumption that the fading coefﬁ- cients are identically distributed. Therefore, with full correlation in fading, we attain the maximum value of cov (z i , z j ) as seen in (24), and wideband slope is minimized.\nThe other extreme case is the one in which the fading coef- ﬁcients {z i } m i =1 in each duration of m symbols are uncorrelated or independent. Now, we have cov (z i , z j ) = 0 for all i = j. Hence, we are left with only the variance terms in the double sum in the denominator of (14), and the wideband slope S 0 can be expressed as\nOverall, we note that the wideband slope increases and conse- quently the energy requirements in the low- SNR regime decreases if the fading correlation becomes lower. Therefore, variations in the channel conditions are favorable for improved energy efﬁciency.\nThe above conclusion can be illustrated numerically. We con- sider a Gauss-Markov fading model and assume that the Gaussian fading coefﬁcients in each block of m symbols follow the correlation pattern h i = αh i −1 + w i where w i is an independent, zero-mean Gaussian random variable with variance E{|w i | 2 } = (1 − α 2 )σ 2 h , α ∈ [0, 1], and σ 2 h is the variance of the fading coefﬁcients h i . Note that when α = 1, we have full correlation, whereas α = 0 models the case of independent fading. In Fig. 1, we plot the normalized effective capacity C E ( SNR ) as a function of the energy per bit E b N\nfor different correlation factors α when θ = 1 and E{z} = E{|h| 2 } = σ 2 h = 1. As predicted by Theorem 1, all curves converge to the same minimum energy per bit of E b N\n= log e 2 E{z} = log e 2 = −1.59 dB as SNR and hence C E ( SNR ) vanish. On the other hand, wideband slopes are different for different values of α. As discussed above, as α and hence correlation diminishes from 1 to 0, slopes increase progressively. It is also interesting note that in the absence of QoS constraints, i.e., when θ = 0, such a distinction will disappear. The wideband slope becomes S 0 = 2(E{z}) 2 E{z 2 } , which clearly does not depend on the fading correlations.\nIn this section, we assume that the arrival rates, rather than being constant as in the previous section, are random. In order\nto unveil the key relationships, we consider a particularly simple two-state model. We assume that data arrival is either in the ON or OFF state in each block duration of m symbols. In the ON state, r bits arrive (i.e., the arrival rate is r bits/block) while there are no arrivals in the OFF state. For this ON-OFF model, the effective bandwidth, which characterizes the minimum constant transmission (or service) rate in bits/block required to support the given data arrival scheme under QoS constraints, is given by [4]\nwhere p 00 denotes the probability of staying in the OFF state from one block to another. Similarly, p 11 denotes the probability of staying in the ON state. The probabilities of transitioning from one state to a different one are therefore denoted by p 10 = 1−p 11 and p 01 = 1−p 00 . For these transition probabilities, we can easily see that the probability of the ON state in the steady state is\nwhich, as pointed out in Section III-B, is equal to the average departure rate when the queue is in steady state [6]. Now, we seek to determine the maximum average arrival rate r ∗ avg that can be supported by the fading channel described in Section II while satisfying the statistical QoS limitations given in the form in (3). As shown in [6, Theorem 2.1], if the effective bandwidth of the arrival process is equal to the effective capacity of the service process, i.e.,\nthen, (3) is satisﬁed, i.e., buffer violation probability decays exponentially fast with rate controlled by the QoS exponent θ. If we denote the solution of (32) by r ∗ ( SNR , θ), then the maximum average arrival rate is\nwhere the normalization with m is due to our assumption that r ∗ avg is in the units of bits per m symbols (or equivalently per block). Consequently, the energy per bit and wideband slope expressions are formulated as\nwhere ˙r ∗ avg (0) and ¨ r ∗ avg (0) denote the ﬁrst and second derivatives, respectively, of r ∗ avg with respect to SNR at SNR = 0.\nIn the following result, we provide the minimum energy per bit and wideband slope expressions for the considered ON-OFF arrival scheme and fading channel model.\nTheorem 2: Assume that the source arrival rate is random and follows the described ON-OFF model. As before, the channel fading changes independently every m symbols while the channel fading coefﬁcients are arbitrarily correlated in each duration of m symbols. Then, the minimum energy per bit and wideband slope expressions as a function of the QoS exponent θ are given, respectively, by\ncov {z i , z j } + E {z 2 } (38)\n2(2 − p 00 − p 11 ) 3 \t . (39)\n, we see that the right hand side of (40) can be expressed as 1 g ( SNR ) where g( SNR ) is deﬁned in (16). Taking the\n˙r( SNR ) θp 11 e rθ 2 + (p 00 + p 11 e rθ )θp 11 − 2(p 00 + p 11 − 1)θe rθ 2 (p 00 + p 11 e rθ ) 2 − 4(p 00 + p 11 − 1)e rθ\nNext, we let SNR → 0. Since the arrival rate r → 0 when SNR → 0, the equality in (41) becomes\n00 − p 11 ) = − ˙g(0) (g(0)) 2 = θ log\n(43) Plugging in the result in (43) into (35), we immediately obtain (37).\nIn order to determine the wideband slope, we ﬁrst take the second derivative of both sides of (40) with respect to SNR and evaluate them at SNR = 0 as\nwhere (44) follows from the fact that g(0) = 1, and ρ is deﬁned in (39). Using the above equality and the expression for ˙r(0) obtained from the equality in (42), we can easily derive the second derivative of the maximum average arrival rate with respect to SNR at SNR = 0 as\nFinally, inserting (43) and (45) into (36), the wideband slope expression in (38) is readily obtained.\nagain turns out to be a very robust quantity. Regardless of the buffer constraints, channel correlations, and randomness of the arrivals, the minimum received energy per bit\n= E{z} E b N 0 min = log e 2 = −1.59 dB. On the other hand, the impact of random arrivals on the wideband slope is perspicuous in (38). When compared to (14), we immediately notice that having random arrivals leads to the introduction of the term (˜ ρ− 1) θm log\n(E {z}) 2 in the denominator of (38). Notice that when p 11 = 1 and p 00 = 0, we have P ON = 1, meaning that we have constant source arrival. In this case, ˜ ρ = 1 and indeed (38) specializes to (14). More generally, we have ˜ ρ−1 ≥ 0 for all p 00 , p 11 ∈ [0, 1]. Therefore, random arrivals potentially decreases the wideband slope and increases the energy requirements.\nThis is more clearly seen in the special case in which p 00 + p 11 = 1. Now, we have ˜ ρ = 1 p\n(46) As P ON = p 11 decreases, the wideband slope decreases as well. Therefore, the source becoming more bursty leads to increased energy per bit. This is illustrated in Fig. 2 where maximum average arrival rate vs. energy per bit is plotted and the same channel fading and correlation model as in Fig. 1 is used. In this ﬁgure, we assume θ = 1 and α = 0.75. As predicted, the minimum bit energies are all the same. However, we have diminishing slopes with decreasing P ON . Note that for a ﬁxed average arrival rate, as P ON gets smaller, source becomes more bursty. Data arrives less frequently but with a higher rate. This in turn increases energy per bit as implied by smaller wideband slopes.\nFinally, we remark that in the absence of buffer limitations (i.e., when θ = 0), we again have S 0 = 2(E{z}) 2 E{z 2 } . Hence, in such a case, source and channel variations do not have any impact on the performance in the low- SNR regime."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"S.
