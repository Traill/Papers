Edge-cut based bounds which are simple bounds on the rates achievable by routing ﬂow are not in general, fundamental, i.e. they are not outer bounds on the capacity region. It has been observed that when the problem has some kind of symmetry involved, then ﬂows and edge-cut based bounds are \u2018close\u2019, i.e. within a constant or poly-logarithmic factor of each other. In this paper, we make the observation that in these very cases, such edge-cut based bounds are actually \u2018close\u2019 to fundamental yielding an approximate characterization of the capacity region for these problems. We demonstrate this in the case of k-unicast in undirected networks, k-pair unicast in directed networks with symmetric demands i.e. for every source communicating to a destination at a certain rate, the destination communicates an independent message back to the source at the same rate, and sum-rate of k-groupcast in directed networks, i.e. a group of nodes, each of which has an independent message for every other node in the group. We place our work in context of existing results to suggest a meta-theorem: if there is inherent symmetry either in the network connectivity or in the trafﬁc pattern, then edge-cut bounds are near-fundamental and ﬂows approximately achieve capacity."},"body":{"text":"The central problem of network information theory is to characterize the capacity region of a general network. Wireline networks are a special class of such networks where the edges between vertices are orthogonal and noise-free. In this class of networks, network coding has the potential to provide signiﬁ- cant advantages in comparison to ﬂow (i.e. routing strategies) for multicast problems [1] as well as for multiple unicast problems [2]. Recent results due to Dougherty, Freiling, Zeger and Chan, Grant suggest that characterizing the capacity region of a multiple unicast network is a hard problem [3], [4], [5]. In particular, even coding strategies such as linear codes do not achieve capacity in general [4].\nOn the other hand, the literature on hardness of cut problems typically deal with edge-cut bounds which are conventional outer bounds on ﬂow. But these bounds are not fundamental bounds on the capacity region [6], i.e. they can often be beaten if network coding is allowed. Although edge-cut bounds in di- rected networks are not fundamental, they are combinatorially well-represented. They are however, hard to approximate in general [7], [8].\nOne class of networks for which edge-cut bounds can be approximated well are undirected networks. Leighton, Rao [9]\nand Linial, London, Rabinovich [10] show that for the problem of k-unicast in undirected networks, ﬂow solutions approach the edge-cut bounds up to a factor of Θ(log k). There has also been discovered a semi-deﬁnite programming relaxation approach that allows an approximation of edge-cut bounds up to a factor of Θ(\nundirected networks, edge-cut bounds can be derived from the vertex bipartition cutset bound and are hence, fundamental outer bounds on the capacity region. Thus, [9], [10] also characterize up to a factor of Θ(log k) the capacity region of k-unicast in undirected networks. It has been conjectured that ﬂow solutions in fact, achieve capacity.\nAnother setting in which edge-cut bounds can be approxi- mated well is the problem of multiple unicast in directed wire- line networks with symmetric demands, i.e. for each source communicating to its destination at a certain rate, there is an independent message to be communicated from the destination back to the source at the same rate. Klein, Plotkin, Rao, Tardos [14] show under this model that ﬂow solutions achieve within Θ(log 2 k) of the edge-cut bounds. We ask the question: \u201cAre these edge-cut bounds fundamental outer bounds on the capacity region?\u201d Surprisingly, the answer turns out to be yes and the proof of this result is one of the main contributions of this paper. This completes an approximate characterization of the capacity region for this class of problems. The key tool we use in the proof is the Generalized Network Sharing (GNS) bound that was ﬁrst developed in [15] for directed wireline networks and was also used subsequently for two- unicast linear deterministic networks [16].\nAnother interesting setting is that of groupcast in directed wireline networks. There is a group of nodes and each node in the group has one independent message for each other node in the group. Naor, Zosin [17] show that the maximum sum-rate achievable by routing ﬂow for groupcast is at least half the multicut , a simple edge-cut based outer bound on ﬂow. We ask the question: \u201cIs the multicut a fundamental upper bound on the sum-rate?\u201d. We ﬁnd that the answer is no, but that twice the multicut is indeed a fundamental upper bound. This shows that routing ﬂow approximately achieves the sum-rate-capacity for groupcast networks.\nWhen there is some kind of symmetry in the network, either in the underlying graph (undirected or bidirected networks) or in the trafﬁc (directed network with symmetric demands or\n\u2022 (Achievability) Algorithmic Meta-Theorem: Edge-cut bounds can be well-approximated either by ﬂows [9], [10], [14], [17], [18] or by other means [11].\n\u2022 (Converse) Information-Theoretic Meta-Theorem: Edge- cut bounds are near-fundamental outer bounds on the capacity region.\n\u2022 Combined Meta-Theorem : Flow approximately achieves capacity.\nIn a companion paper [19], we use the results of this paper and achievability results similar to [14] which have been obtained for the class of polymatroidal networks [18] to study the capacity regions of multiple unicast with symmetric demands in different classes of Gaussian networks. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We set up notation and preliminaries in Section II. We brieﬂy state the Generalized Network Sharing (GNS) bound in Section III. We then discuss k-unicast undirected networks in Section IV, k-pair unicast directed symmetric-demand networks in Section V and k- groupcast directed networks in Section VI. We ﬁnally conclude with a discussion in Section VII.\nDeﬁnition. A k-unicast directed network N for source- destination pairs {(s i ; d i ) } i∈I with |I| = k (for instance, I := {1, 2, . . . , k}) is a tuple (G, C) where\n\u2022 G = (V, E) is the underlying directed graph with vertex set V and edge set E, with s i , d i ∈ V(G) for i ∈ I,\n\u2022 C = ( C e : e ∈ E(G)) is the edge-capacity vector, with C e ∈ R ≥0 ∪ {∞} ∀e ∈ E(G).\nFor each i ∈ I, s i has independent information to be communicated to d i at rate R i .\nNotation. For v ∈ V(G), let In(v) and Out(v) denote the edges entering into and leaving v respectively.\nDeﬁnition. Given a k-unicast directed network N = (G, C) for source-destination pairs {(s i ; d i ) } i∈I , we say that the non- negative rate tuple ( R i : i ∈ I) is achievable if for any > 0 , there exist positive integers N and T (called block length and number of epochs respectively), a ﬁnite alphabet A with |A| ≥ 2 and using notation H v := Π i∈I :v=s i A N T R i (with an empty product being the singleton set),\nwith the property that under the uniform probability distribu- tion on Π i∈I A N T R i ,\nwhere g : Π i∈I A N T R i → Π i∈I A N T R i is the global de- coding function induced inductively by {f e,t : e ∈ E(G), 1 ≤ t ≤ T } and {f d i : i ∈ I}. The closure of the set of achievable rate tuples is called the capacity region and is\ndenoted by C. Deﬁne the sum-rate-capacity by C sum−rate := sup (R\nDeﬁnition. Given a k-unicast directed network N = (G, C) for source-destination pairs {(s i ; d i ) } i∈I , we say that the non- negative rate tuple ( R i : i ∈ I) is achievable by routing ﬂow if there exist for each i ∈ I and each e = (u, v) ∈ E(G), real numbers f i,e ≥ 0 such that i∈I f i,e ≤ C e ∀ e ∈ E(G), and for each i ∈ I and each v ∈ V(G),\n  \n0 \t if v = s i , d i , R i if v = s i , −R i if v = d i .\nThe closure of the set of rate tuples achievable by routing ﬂow is called the ﬂow region and is denoted by F. Deﬁne the sum-rate-max-ﬂow by F sum−rate := sup (R i :i∈I)∈F i∈I R i\nDeﬁnition. Given a k unicast directed network N = (G, C) for source-destination pairs {(s i ; d i ) } i∈I , we deﬁne the edge- cut outer bound , denoted by R edge−cut , to be the set of all non- negative tuples ( R i : i ∈ I) that satisfy for every E ⊆ E(G), the inequality i∈J R i ≤ e∈E C e where index i ∈ J ⊆ I if and only if G \\ E has no directed paths from s i to d i . We deﬁne the multicut, denoted by R multicut , to be the minimum value of e∈E C e over all E ⊆ E(G) with the property that G \\ E has no directed paths from s i to d i for each i ∈ I.\nRemark 1. R multicut may in general be strictly larger than the tighter bound on F sum−rate given by\nWhile it is clear that F ⊆ R edge−cut and F ⊆ C, the connection between C and R edge−cut is unclear. It is easy to show examples where C ⊆ R edge−cut . Thus, simple edge-cut based outer bounds are not in general, fundamental, i.e. they are not outer bounds on the capacity region. Likewise it is clear\nC sum−rate and R multicut have no apparent connection. Indeed, [2] provides a series of k-unicast networks, one for each k\nC ⊆ (k − )R edge−cut for any > 0. [20] shows that the gap between F and R edge−cut can be as large as k − for any\nDeﬁnition. Given a directed network N = (G, C) with a set of 2 r distinguished vertices w 1 , w 2 , . . . , w r , w 1 , w 2 , . . . , w r , if a set of edges E ⊆ E(G) has the property that G \\ E has no directed paths from w i to w j whenever π(i) ≥ π(j), 1 ≤ i, j ≤ r, for some permutation π : {1, 2, . . . , r} → {1, 2, . . . , r}, then we say that E is a GNS-cut for {w 1 , w 2 , . . . , w r ; w 1 , w 2 , . . . , w r }.\nTheorem 1. (Generalized Network Sharing (GNS) bound from Kamath-Tse-Anantharam [15])\nLet N = (G, C) be a k-unicast directed network for source- destination pairs {s i ; d i } i∈I . If, for J = {j 1 , j 2 , . . . , j r } ⊆ I and E ⊆ E(G), we have that E is a GNS-cut for\n{s j 1 , s j 2 , . . . , s j r ; d j 1 , d j 2 , . . . , d j r }, then for all (R i : i ∈ I) ∈ C, we have j∈J R j ≤ e∈E C e .\nWe skip the proof of Theorem 1 due to lack of space. The essential idea is contained in [15]. The GNS bound is to the capacity region what the edge-cut bound is to the commodity ﬂow region, namely an intuitive outer bound that arises from simple connectivity properties of the underlying graph of the network.\nWe have skipped the natural counterpart deﬁnitions of F, C, R edge−cut for undirected networks due to lack of space. All statements in this section refer to k-unicast undirected networks.\nTheorem 2. (Leighton-Rao [9], Linial-London-Rabinovich [10])\nTheorem 3 follows from the vertex bipartition cutset bound and we omit the proof here. Theorems 2 and 3 together imply that routing ﬂow is approximately capacity-achieving:\nIndeed, the Li and Li conjecture states that ﬂow achieves capacity for k-unicast in undirected graphs.\nConjecture 5. (Li-Li [12], Harvey-Kleinberg-Lehman [13]) F = C.\nDeﬁnition. A k-pair unicast directed symmetric-demand network is a 2 k-unicast directed network N with 2k distinct distinguished nodes (source-destination nodes) u 1 , u 2 , . . . , u k , v 1 , v 2 , . . . , v k with source-destination pairs {s i ; d i } i∈I where I = {1, 2, . . . , k} ∪ {−1, −2, . . . , −k} and for i > 0 , s i = u i , d i = v i , while for i < 0, s i = v −i , d i = u −i . The rate tuple (R i : 1 ≤ i ≤ k) is deﬁned to be in the capacity region C, ﬂow region F, edge-cut outer bound R edge−cut for the k-pair unicast directed symmetric-demand network if the rate tuple ( R i : i ∈ I), given by R i = R |i| for i ∈ I, lies in the capacity region, ﬂow region, edge-cut outer bound respectively of the 2 k-unicast directed network.\nRemark 2. There is no loss of generality in assuming u 1 , u 2 , . . . , u k , v 1 , v 2 , . . . , v k distinct since if they aren\u2019t, we can add more nodes and inﬁnite capacity edges to make them distinct while obtaining a network with identical capacity region.\nDeﬁnition. Given a k-pair unicast directed symmetric- demand network N = (G, C) with source-destination nodes u 1 , u 2 , . . . , u k , v 1 , v 2 , . . . , v k , we deﬁne the GNS-cut outer bound , denoted by R GNS−cut , to be the set of all non-negative tuples ( R i : 1 ≤ i ≤ k) that satisfy for every E ⊆ E(G), the inequality i∈J R i ≤ e∈E C e whenever E is a GNS-cut for {w 1 , w 2 , . . . , w r ; w 1 , w 2 , . . . , w r } where\n\u2022 for 1 ≤ j ≤ r, (w j , w j ) = ( u i , v i ) or ( v i , u i ) for some i ∈ J.\nWe deﬁne a weak edge-cut outer bound for this class of networks.\nDeﬁnition. Given a k-pair unicast directed symmetric- demand network N = (G, C) with source-destination nodes u 1 , u 2 , . . . , u k , v 1 , v 2 , . . . , v k , we deﬁne the weak-edge-cut outer bound , denoted by R weak−edge−cut , to be the set of all non-negative tuples ( R i : 1 ≤ i ≤ k) that satisfy for every E ⊆ E(G), the inequality i∈J R i ≤ e∈E C e where index i ∈ J ⊆ {1, 2, . . . , k} if and only if G \\ E has no directed paths from either u i to v i or v i to u i or both.\nAll statements in this section refer to k-pair unicast directed symmetric-demand networks.\nTheorems 6, 7 and 8 together imply that routing ﬂow is approximately capacity-achieving: Corollary 9.\nu 2 \t u 3 u\nWe conjecture that network coding can improve rates by at most a constant factor α for k-pair unicast symmetric demand networks, where α does not depend on k.\nConjecture 10. (Analog of the Li and Li conjecture) F ⊆ C ⊆ α F.\nFor the 1-pair unicast symmetric demand network in Fig. 1 with v 1 = s 1 , v 2 = d 1 the simple XOR coding scheme shows that if Conjecture 10 is true, then we must have α ≥ 2. It also shows that in general, C ⊆ R edge−cut for these networks.\nNow, we prove the equivalence between weak-edge-cuts and GNS-cuts for k-pair unicast directed symmetric-demand networks, thus proving Theorem 8.\nProof: It is easy to see that the inequality obtained from a GNS-cut can always be obtained from a weak-edge-cut since a GNS-cut requires stronger disconnections as compared to a weak-edge-cut. This gives R weak−edge−cut ⊆ R GNS−cut . To show R GNS−cut ⊆ R weak−edge−cut , we now consider E ⊆ E(G), and say i ∈ J ⊆ {1, 2, . . . , k} if and only if G \\ E has no directed paths from either u i to v i or from v i to u i or both. We show that E is a GNS-cut for {w 1 , w 2 , . . . , w r ; w 1 , w 2 , . . . , w r } where the 2r vertices w 1 , w 2 , . . . , w r , w 1 , w 2 , . . . , w r are all distinct and for 1 ≤ j ≤ r, (w j , w j ) = ( u i , v i ) or ( v i , u i ) for some i ∈ J with |J| = r. We will prove this for the case J = {1, 2, . . . , k}. The proof for other choices of J is similar.\nDeﬁne the connectivity graph G c as a directed graph over 2 k vertices u 1 , u 2 , . . . , u k , v 1 , v 2 , . . . , v k as follows. For every pair of distinct vertices w and z, there is a directed edge from w to z in G c if and only if w has a directed path to z in G \\E. See Fig. 2(a) for an example. G c is transitively closed, i.e. for three distinct vertices w, z, x, if w has an edge to z and z has an edge to x, then w has an edge to x.\nNow, deﬁne the reduced connectivity graph G r as the directed acyclic graph with vertices represented by the strongly connected components of G c . See Fig. 2(b) for an example. For each i = 1, 2, . . . , k, we have that u i and v i do not lie in the same strongly connected component. Note that a directed\nacyclic graph has at least one sink vertex, i.e. a vertex with no outgoing edges. Consider the following algorithm that ﬁlls in the cells of an initially empty k × 2 table with vertex names from u 1 , u 2 , . . . , u k , v 1 , v 2 , . . . , v k .\n(2) List the vertices of G c in the strongly connected compo- nent represented by the chosen sink vertex. (a) Pick a vertex w from the list.\n(b) If vertex w has been entered previously in the table, do nothing. Else, add vertex w in the ﬁrst column of the lowest row in the table not yet ﬁlled. Add the destination of vertex w in the second column of the same row, e.g. if v 3 was entered in the ﬁrst column of the lowest available row, then ﬁll u 3 in the second column.\n(c) Remove w from the list and go back to (a) if the list is still non-empty, else proceed to (3)\n(3) Modify graph G r by deleting the chosen sink vertex. If this graph has non-zero number of vertices, go to step (1), else quit.\nIt is easy to verify that the following properties hold upon termination of the algorithm. For an example, see Fig. 3.\n( i) Each of u 1 , u 2 , . . . , u k , v 1 , v 2 , . . . , v k shows up exactly once in the table.\n( ii) Each row of the table is made up of vertices u i and v i for some i.\n( iii) In graph G c , vertex w obtained from the ﬁrst column of row i does not have an edge to vertex z obtained from the second column of row j whenever i ≥ j.\nNow, if the j th row of the table consists of u i , v i , we set π(j) = i and (w i , w i ) = ( u i , v i ) or ( v i , u i ) depending on whether the ﬁrst entry in the row is u i or v i . This shows that E is a GNS-cut for {w 1 , w 2 , . . . , w k ; w 1 , w 2 , . . . , w k } with permutation π. This gives R weak−edge−cut ⊇ R GNS−cut and completes the proof.\nDeﬁnition. A k-groupcast directed network is a k(k − 1)- unicast directed network N with k distinct distinguished\nnodes (group-nodes) v 1 , v 2 , . . . , v k with source-destination pairs {s (i,j) ; d (i,j) } (i,j)∈I where I = {(i, j) : 1 ≤ i, j ≤ k, i = j } and s (i,j) = v i , d (i,j) = v j for all ( i, j) ∈ I.\nAll statements in this section refer to k-groupcast directed networks.\nTheorem 11. (Naor-Zosin [17]) 1 2\nTheorems 11 and 12 together imply that routing ﬂow is approximately capacity-achieving for sum-rate:\nCorollary 13. 1 2\nWe give the proof of Theorem 12. Proof:\nConsider a k-groupcast directed network N with group- nodes v 1 , v 2 , . . . , v k . Let E be a set of edges such that G \\ E has no directed paths from v i to v j for each ( i, j) ∈ I. Let ( R (i,j) : ( i, j) ∈ I) ∈ C. Observe that E is a GNS- cut for source-destination pairs {s (i,j) ; d (i,j) } (i,j)∈I:i>j . The- orem 1 gives (i,j)∈I:i>j R (i,j) ≤ e∈E C e . Similarly, we can get (i,j)∈I:i<j R (i,j) ≤ e∈E C e . Adding, we obtain\nRemark 4. For the groupcast network in Fig. 1, the simple XOR coding scheme shows that the factor 2 in the statement of Theorem 12 cannot be improved upon.\nIt is intriguing that the kinds of symmetry that lead to ﬂow - edge-cut closeness results also lead to the near-fundamentality of such edge-cuts. It would be interesting to ﬁnd a deeper explanation of this phenomenon.\nResearch support for the ﬁrst author from the ARO MURI grant W911NF- 08-1-0233, Tools for the Analysis and De- sign of Complex Multi-Scale Networks, from the NSF grant CNS- 0910702, from the NSF Science and Technology Center grant CCF-0939370, Science of Information, from Marvell Semiconductor Inc., and from the U.C.
