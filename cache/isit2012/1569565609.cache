The original motivation for studying these codes comes from fault diagnosis in multiprocessor systems. In multiprocessor systems, where processors are linked to the other ones, identifying codes can be deﬁned as follows. Assign to a set of processors the following task: each processor outputs a single value true if the processor itself or one of the neighbouring ones are malfunctioning, and otherwise false is outputted. We say that this set of chosen processors forms an identifying code if the malfunctioning processor(s) can be located using solely the information provided by the selected processors. Similarly, identifying codes can be applied for locating objects in sensor networks as was suggested by Ray et al. in [14]. Moreover, identifying codes ﬁnd their motivation also in various other applications such as environmental monitoring [2], routing in wireless networks [12], and ﬁre and intruder alarm systems [15].\nFor the formal deﬁnition of identifying codes, we ﬁrst need to introduce some preliminary notations. Let G = (V, E) be\na simple, connected and undirected graph with V as the set of vertices and E as the set of edges. Let u and v be vertices in V . If u and v are adjacent to each other, then the edge between u and v is denoted by {u, v} or in short by uv. The distance between u and v is denoted by d(u, v) and is deﬁned as the number of edges in any shortest path between u and v. Let r be a positive integer. We say that u r-covers v if the distance d(u, v) is at most r. The ball of radius r centered at u is deﬁned as\nA nonempty subset of V is called a code in G, and its elements are called codewords. Let C ⊆ V be a code and u be a vertex in V . An I-set (or an identifying set) of the vertex u with respect to the code C is deﬁned as\nDeﬁnition 1. Let r be a positive integer. A code C ⊆ V is said to be r-identifying in G if for all u, v ∈ V (u = v) the set I r (C; u) is nonempty and\nLet X and Y be subsets of V . The symmetric difference of X and Y is deﬁned as X △ Y = (X \\ Y ) ∪ (Y \\ X). We say that the vertices u and v are r-separated by a code C ⊆ V (or by a codeword of C) if the symmetric difference I r (C; u) △ I r (C; v) is nonempty. The deﬁnition of r-identifying codes can now be reformulated as follows: C ⊆ V is an r-identifying code in G if and only if for all u, v ∈ V (u = v) the vertex u is r-covered by a codeword of C and\nIn this paper, we study identifying codes in the inﬁnite square and hexagonal grids. We deﬁne the square grid G S = (V S , E S ) as follows: the set of vertices V S = Z 2 and the set of edges E S = {{u, v} | u, v ∈ Z 2 , u−v ∈ {(0, ±1), (±1, 0)}}. In other words, two vertices are adjacent in G S if the Eu- clidean distance between them is equal to 1. Part of the inﬁnite square grid G S and a 2-identifying code in G S are illustrated\nin Figure 1, where lines represent the edges and intersections of the lines represent the vertices of G S , and the codewords are marked as shaded dots.\nThe hexagonal grid G H = (V H , E H ) using the brick wall representation is deﬁned as follows: the set of vertices V H = Z 2 and the set of edges E H = {{u = (i, j), v} | u, v ∈ Z 2 , u − v ∈ {(0, (−1) i +j+1 ), (±1, 0)}}. Part of the inﬁnite hexagonal grid G H and a 2-identifying in G H are illustrated in Figure 2.\nIn order to measure the size of an identifying code in the inﬁnite hexagonal and square grids, we introduce the notion of density. For the formal deﬁnition, we ﬁrst deﬁne\nNaturally, we try to construct identifying codes with as small density as possible. Moreover, we say that an r-identifying code is optimal, if there do not exist any r-identifying codes with smaller density.\nPreviously, r-identifying codes in the square grid G S have been studied in various papers. In the case r = 1, a 1- identifying code in G S with density 7/20 is constructed in [5]. Moreover, it has been proved by Ben-Haim and Litsyn [1] that\nthis construction is optimal, i.e. there do not exist 1-identifying codes in G S with smaller density. For general r ≥ 2, Charon et al. [3] showed that each r-identifying code C in G S has density D(C) ≥ 3/(8r + 4). Furthermore, Honkala and Lobstein [8] presented r-identifying codes in the square with D(C) = 2/(5r) if r is even and D(C) = 2r/(5r 2 − 2r + 1) if r is odd. For small values of r, these general constructions have been improved in [4] by Charon et al.\nIn [8], besides the general constructions, Honkala and Lobstein also presented a 2-identifying code with density 5/29 ≈ 0.172 (see Figure 1). By the general lower bound mentioned above, we know that each 2-identifying code C in G S satisﬁes D(C) ≥ 3/20 = 0.15. This general lower bound was improved by Martin and Stanton in [13] by showing that the density of any 2-identifying code in the square grid is at least 6/37 ≈ 0.162. In this paper, we further improve this lower bound to 6/35 ≈ 0.171 hence signiﬁcantly reducing the gap between the lower and upper bounds.\nAs in the square grid G S , r-identifying codes have also been intensively studied in the hexagonal grid G H . The ﬁrst results concerning r-identifying codes in G H have been presented in the seminal paper [11] in the case r = 1. Later these results have been improved by showing that there exists a 1-identifying code with density 3/7 (see Cohen et al. [6]) and that there do not exist 1-identifying codes in G H with density smaller than 12/29 (see Cranston and Yu [7]). For general r ≥ 2, Charon et al. [3] showed that each r-identifying code C in G H has D(C) ≥ 2/(5r + 3) if r is even and D(C) ≥ 2/(5r + 2) if r is odd. Moreover, Stanton [17] presented a construction for each r ≥ 2 giving an r-identifying code C ⊆ V H with D(C) ∼ 5/(6r).\nFor small values of r, the previous constructions have been improved in [4] by Charon et al. In particular, it is shown that there exists a 2-identifying code in G H with density 4/19. In the case r = 2, the aforementioned general lower bound is improved in Martin and Stanton [13] by showing that the density of any 2-identifying code in G H is at least 1/5. In this paper, we further improve this lower bound to 4/19. In other words, we show that the previously presented 2-identifying code with density 4/19 is optimal.\nThe proofs of the lower bounds are based on a technique which combines the concept of share with an averaging process. The share and its usage in obtaining lower bounds are explained in Section II. The actual proofs (or sketches of them) with the averaging process for the square and hexagonal grids are presented in Sections III and IV, respectively. The presentation of the paper is based on [9] and [10] (see arXiv).\nLet G = (V, E) be a simple, connected and undirected graph. Assume that C is a code in G. The following concept of the share of a codeword has been introduced by Slater in [16]. The share of a codeword c ∈ C is deﬁned as\nThe notion of share proves to be useful in determining lower bounds of r-identifying codes (as explained in the following).\nAssume that G = (V, E) is a ﬁnite graph and D is a code in G such that B r (u) ∩ D is nonempty for all u ∈ V . Then it is easy to conclude that c∈D s r (D; c) = |V |. Assume further that s r (D; c) ≤ α for all c ∈ D. Then we have |V | ≤ α|D|, which immediately implies\nAssume then that for any r-identifying code C in G we have s r (C; c) ≤ α for all c ∈ C. By the aforementioned observation, we then obtain the lower bound |V |/α for the size of an r-identifying code in G. In other words, by determining the maximum share, we obtain a lower bound for the minimum size of an r-identifying code.\nThe previous reasoning can also be generalized to the case when an inﬁnite graph is considered. More precisely, if for any r-identifying code C in an inﬁnite graph we have s r (C; c) ≤ α for all c ∈ C, then it can be shown that the density of an r-identifying code is at least 1/α (compare to Theorems 5 and 6). The proofs of the lower bounds (in Sections III and IV) are based on this observation, although we use a more sophisticated method by showing an upper bound for the share of a codeword on average. In Theorem(s) 5 (and 6), we present a formal proof to verify that this method is indeed valid.\nIn the proof of the lower bound, we need to determine upper bounds for shares of codewords. To formally present a way to estimate shares, we ﬁrst need to introduce some notations. Let D ⊆ V be a code and c be a codeword of D. Consider then the I-sets I r (D; u) when u goes through all the vertices in B r (c). (Notice that all of these I-sets do not have to be different.) Denote the different identifying sets by I 1 , I 2 , . . . , I k , where k is a positive integer. Furthermore, denote the number of identifying sets equal to I j by i j (j = 1, 2, . . . , k). Now we are ready to present the following lemma, which provides a method to estimate the shares of the codewords.\nLemma 2. Let C be an r-identifying code in G and let D be a nonempty subset of C. For c ∈ D, using the previous notations, we have\nProof: Assume that c ∈ D. Then, for each j = 1, 2, . . . , k, deﬁne I j = {u ∈ B r (c) | I j = I r (D; u)}. Now it is obvious that for at most one vertex u ∈ I j we have I j = I r (C; u) and the other vertices of I j are r-covered by at least |I j | + 1 codewords of C. Hence, the claim immediately follows.\nThe previous lemma ﬁnds out to be very useful for ap- proximating shares of codewords. The use of the lemma is illustrated in the following example in the square grid.\nExample 3. Let C be a 2-identifying code in the square grid G S . Assume that D = {(−1, 0), (0, 0), (1, 1)} is a subset of\nC (see Figure 3). Now we have the following facts (which correspond to the dashed areas in the ﬁgure):\nI 2 (D; u) = {(0, 0), (1, 1)} for u = (0, 2), (1, −1), (1, 1) or (2, 0),\nI 2 (D; u) = {(−1, 0), (0, 0), (1, 1)} for u = (−1, 1), (0, 0), (0, 1) or (1, 0),\nI 2 (D; u) = {(−1, 0), (0, 0)} for u = (−2, 0), (−1, −1), (−1, 0) or (0, −1), and\nThus, by Lemma 2, we obtain that s 2 (C; (0, 0)) ≤ (1/2 + 3 · 1/3) + (1/3 + 3 · 1/4) + (1/2 + 3 · 1/3) + 1 = 61/12.\nThe following presentation is based on [9, Section 3]. Here we present the main ideas of the proof and for the details the interested reader is referred to the full paper. For the rest of the section, assume that C is a 2-identifying code in G S . In what follows, we show that on average the share of a codeword is at most 35/6.\nThe averaging process is done by introducing a shifting scheme designed to even out the shares among the codewords of C. The shifting scheme for the square grid consists of 10 different rules. The modiﬁed share of a codeword c ∈ C, which is obtained after the shifting scheme is applied, is denoted by ¯ s 2 (c). It can be shown that we have ¯ s 2 (c) ≤ 35/6 for all c ∈ C. The following example illustrates one of the ten rules in the scheme and its usage to even out the share among codewords.\nExample 4. One of the ten rules in the shifting scheme is illustrated in Figure 4(a). In the rule, 1/20 units of share is shifted from u to v. In addition to the constellation in the ﬁgure, translations, rotations (by π/2, π and 3π/2 about the vertex u) and reﬂections (over the line passing vertically through u) can be applied to the rule in such a way that structure of the underlying graph G S is preserved.\nConsider then the codeword c = (0, 0) with the con- stellation of codewords and non-codewords inside B 4 (c) as illustrated in Figure 4(b). The share of the codeword c is 6, i.e. s 2 (c) = 6. The introduced rule can be applied to\nc to each of the vertices (−3, 0), (0, −3), (0, 3) and (3, 0). (Recall that translations, rotations and reﬂections can be ap- plied to the constellation in Figure 4(a).) Therefore, we have ¯ s 2 (c) = s 2 (c)−4·1/20 = 6−1/5 = 29/5 ≤ 35/6. Moreover, it can be shown that the shares of the codewords (−3, 0), (0, −3), (0, 3) and (3, 0) are at most 35/6 even after share is shifted to them.\n∈ C. Hence, we are now ready to present the main theorem of the section.\nTheorem 5. If C is a 2-identifying code in the square grid G S , then the density\nProof: Assume that C is a 2-identifying code in G S . Notice that each vertex u ∈ Q n− 2 with |I 2 (u)| = i contributes the summand 1/i to s 2 (c) for each of the i codewords\nIndeed, shifting shares inside Q n does not affect the sum and each codeword in Q n +3 \\ Q n can receive at most 35/6 units of share (since ¯ s 2 (c) ≤ 35/6 for all c ∈ C). Studying the ten rules of the shifting scheme, it can be concluded that codewords in Q n cannot shift share to codewords outside Q n +3 . Therefore, combining the equations (1) and (2) with the fact that ¯ s 2 (c) ≤ 35/6 for any c ∈ C, we obtain that\nSince |Q k | = (2k + 1) 2 for any positive integer k, it is straightforward to conclude from the previous inequality that the density D(C) ≥ 6/35.\nThe following considerations are based on [10, Section 3]. For the rest of the section, assume that C is a 2-identifying code in G H . It can be shown that s 2 (c) ≤ 5 for all c ∈ C. This provides another approach to obtain the lower bound D(C) ≥ 1/5, which was previously shown in [13]. In order to improve this lower bound, we need to consider the shares of codewords on average. Using a shifting scheme consisting of 10 different rules and some modiﬁcations of them, we can show that on average the share of a codeword is at most 19/4. Therefore, using a proof similar to Theorem 5, we obtain the following result.\nTheorem 6. If C is a 2-identifying code in the hexagonal grid G H , then the density\nIn other words, we have shown that the 2-identifying code with density 4/19 is optimal.\nThe ﬁrst author is supported by the V¨ais¨al¨a Foundation of the Finnish Academy of Science and Letters."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"Y.
