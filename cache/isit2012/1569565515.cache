They govern the discretization of errors in stabilizer codes [1], [4], [5], subsystem codes [2], [10], and other classes of quantum error-correcting codes [9]. Nice error bases found applications in the construction of mutually unbiased bases [3], teleportation and dense coding schemes [14].\nA nice error basis E is a set of unitary d × d matrices D(g) parametrized by a ﬁnite group G, called the index group, such that\n\u2022 the trace Tr(D(g) \u2020 D(h)) is zero for all g, h of G with g = h, where D(g) \u2020 denotes the Hermitian transpose of the matrix D(g),\n\u2022 the product of two matrices in E is contained in E up to multiplication with a scalar factor, that is D(g)D(h) = w(g, h)D(gh) for some complex scalar w(g, h).\nThe essence of this deﬁnition is that E is an orthogonal basis with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product on the vector space of complex d × d matrices, and it has the additional feature that any product of the matrices in E is again a matrix in E up to a scalar multiple.\nIt will be instructive to look at two examples of nice error bases.\nExample 1. A well-known example of a nice error basis is the Pauli basis\nwhere F 2 is the ﬁnite ﬁeld with two elements, and X and Z are the Pauli matrices given by\nIn this case, the index group G is given by the additive group G = F 2 × F 2 .\nThe Pauli basis can be generalized to ﬁnite ﬁelds as follows. Example 2. Let F q be a ﬁnite ﬁeld of characteristic p with q elements. Let {|x | x ∈ F q } denote an orthonormal basis of the vector space C q with respect to the usual hermitian inner product. For a, b in F q , we can deﬁne unitary operators X(a) and Z(b) by\nwhere tr denotes the absolute trace of the ﬁnite ﬁeld F q to its prime subﬁeld. The set B = {X(a)Z(b) | a, b ∈ F q } forms the generalized Pauli basis. This is a nice error basis that is indexed by the additive group (F 2 q , +).\nOf course, Example 2 contains Example 1 as a special case. Furthermore, the basis elements are often multiplied with some phase factor, but such a change is of course inconsequential.\nAre further examples of nice error bases known? Yes, in fact, all nice error bases with an abelian index group have been classiﬁed [7]. Even all nice error bases with small nonabelian index groups are known. Yet, the Examples 1 and 2 dominate the applications of nice error bases. This prompts the question: What makes the error bases given in Examples 1 and 2 so special?\nLet us investigate some of the properties of the generalized Pauli basis. The elements of this basis are of the form X(a)Z(b) with a, b in F q . The operator X(a) induces a permutation of the basis states\nso this action is determined by the additive group (F q , +) of the ﬁnite ﬁeld F q . On the other hand, the operator Z(b) exploits the multiplicative structure of the ﬁnite ﬁeld,\nIn other words, the functions χ b form the phase factors in Z(b)|x = χ b (x)|x . Then the set {χ b | b ∈ F q } consists precisely of all additive irreducible characters of F q , see [11, Theorem 5.7].\nThe characters relate the additive and multiplicative struc- ture of the ﬁeld, since all additive characters can be derived from the generating character χ(x) = χ 1 (x) by multiplying the argument of χ with a ﬁxed ﬁeld element b, namely\nEven though the situation might appear to be typical for ﬁnite ﬁelds, we will boldly axiomatize the properties that we have discovered in the preceding example. In fact, we will use a ﬁnite set N with an addition + and multiplication operation · and a character χ of (N, +) such that the set\nWe tried to impose few restriction on the addition and muli- pliation operations. By inspecting the need for quantum error- correction, we were led to consider the case where (N, +, ·) has the structure of a nearring.\nIn this section, we introduce a data structure that supports the construction of nice error bases. These nice error bases are indexed by ﬁnite nearrings instead of a ﬁnite ﬁelds, yet the construction very closely resembles the case of ﬁnite ﬁelds. Not all ﬁnite nearrings can be used for this purpose. We introduce the class of nice nearrings that allow one to construct nice error bases. Furthermore, we establish basic properties of such nearrings.\nA set N that is equipped with an addition operation + and a multiplication operation · such that\n(a) (N, +) is a (not necessarily abelian) group, (b) (N, ·) is a semigroup,\n(c) and the left-distributive law x(y + z) = xy + xz holds for all x, y, z in N ,\nis called a (left) nearring. We will consider only ﬁnite near- rings. For some background on nearrings, see e.g. [12], [13].\nLet N be a ﬁnite nearring with q elements, {|x | x ∈ N } an orthonormal basis of C q . For a, b in N , we can deﬁne the operators\nFor a function χ on N and a nearring element b in N , let us denote by χ b the function χ b (x) = χ(bx) for all x in N .\nLemma 1. Let N be a left nearring. If χ is a character of (N, +), then χ b is a character of (N, +).\nProof: Let D be a representation of the group (N, +) affording the character χ. The left distributive law of N yields D(b(x + y)) = D(bx + by) = D(bx)D(by). So x → D(bx) is a representation of (N, +) affording the character χ b .\nWe call two complex d × d matrices A and B trace- orthogonal if and only if Tr(A \u2020 B) = 0.\nLemma 2. The matrices in {X(a)Z(b) | a, b ∈ N } are pair- wise trace-orthogonal if and only if the characters {χ b | b ∈ N } are pairwise orthogonal.\nProof: For a, b, a , b in N , we have that the trace Tr((X(a )Z(b )) \u2020 X(a)Z(b)) is equal to\n   \n  \nA multiplicative semigroup (N, ·) is called left reductive if and only if ax = bx for all x in N implies that a = b.\nProposition 3. If {X(a)Z(b) | a, b ∈ N } is a nice error basis then we necessarily have that\n(a) the character χ is a linear and irreducible, (b) (N, +) is an abelian group,\n(a) The elements of a nice error basis are unitary operators, hence preserve the norm of a vector. The vector Z(b)|0 = χ(b0)|0 = χ(0)|0 is of unit norm if and only if χ is a character of degree 1. Therefore, we can conclude that χ(0) = 1 must hold, which proves claim (a).\n(b) A nice error basis consists of a set of pairwise trace- orthogonal matrices. By the previous lemma and part (a), the set of characters {χ b | b ∈ N } is a set of |N | distinct linear irreducible character. These are all irreducible char- acters of (N, +), since the sum of their degrees squared equals |N |. Therefore, (N, +) must be an abelian group.\n(c) Seeking a contradiction, suppose that (N, ·) is not left reductive. This means that there must exist two distinct elements a, b in N such that ax = bx holds for all x in N . However, then χ a = χ b , even though these characters are supposed to be orthogonal by the previous lemma.\nLet us call a ﬁnite nearring nice if and only if there exists a character χ such that {X(a)Z(b) | a, b ∈ N } is a nice error basis.\nA nice nearring has signiﬁcantly more structure than a general ﬁnite nearring. For example, we note the following consequence of the previous proposition.\nCorollary 4. Let N be a nice nearring. Then N is an abelian nearring, that is, (N, +) is an abelian group.\nWe should emphasize that in an abelian nearring, the multi- plication operation might not be commutative. In fact, we will see later that there exist nice nearrings with non-commutative multiplications. The point of the previous corollary is that the addition operation is commutative in nice nearrings.\nLet us explore some more properties of nice nearrings. Let N be a left nearring. It follows from the left-distributive law that x0 = 0 holds for all x in N . On the other hand, in a left nearring 0x is not necessarily 0. A nearring is called zero-symmetric if and only if 0x = 0 holds for all x in N . Obviously, it can be quite cumbersome to work with nearrings that are not zero-symmetric. The next proposition shows that nice nearrings behave well with respect to the multiplication by 0.\nProof: Let N be a nice nearring. A nearring N can be written in the form\nwhere N 0 = {x ∈ N | 0x = 0} is the zero-symmetric subnearring of N , and N c = {0x | x ∈ N } is the constant subnearring. An element in N 0 ∩ N c must be equal to 0.\nFor x in N c , we have χ b (x) = χ(x) for all b in N . Hence there must be some b such that χ b is the trivial character, so χ(x) = 1. Therefore, x lies in the kernel of all characters χ b of (N, +). In a nice nearring, the characters {χ b | b ∈ N } coincides with the set of all irreducible characters, so x must be 0. Therefore, we can concude that N c = {0} and thus N = N 0 .\nA nearring does not need to have a multiplicative identity, since (N, ·) is only assumed to be a semigroup but not necessarily a group. An element e in N such that en = n holds for all n in N is called a left identity of N . Similarly, an element e in N such that ne = n holds for all n in N is called a right identity of N . Our next goal is to show that a nice nearring contains a unique left identity.\nLet us introduce some more notation. For any subset S of a nearring N , let\nAn element a in a nearring N is called a left zero divisor if and only if there exists an element b in B such that ab = 0.\nProof: Seeking a contradiction, we assume that N is a nice nearring that does not contain a left identity.\nSuppose that the left annihilator Ann(N ) contains a nonzero element b. By Proposition 5, a nice nearring is zerosymmetric; thus, χ b (x) = χ 0 (x) = χ(0) = 1 for all x in N . However, it is impossible that the characters χ 0 and χ b coincide, since N is by hypothesis a nice nearring. Therefore, the left annihilator Ann(N ) must be equal to {0}.\nWe claim that in a ﬁnite nearring without left identity and Ann(N ) = {0}, every element must be a left zero divisor. Indeed, if there would exist an element a in N that is not a left zero divisor, then bN would have to coincide with N . In other words, left multiplication by a would be an automorphism of (N, +). This would imply that there exists an exponent k such that left multiplication with a k induces the identity map on (N, +). However, this is impossible, since we assumed that N does not contain a left identity. Therefore, we can conclude that every element of N must be a left zero divisor.\nSince N is a nice nearring, there must exists a nonzero element a in N such that χ a = χ. As a is a left zero divisor, there must exist a nonzero element b such that ab = 0. In other words, bN is contained in the kernel of χ. However, this would imply that the kernel of χ b is N , and therefore the character χ b would have to coincide with χ 0 , which is impossible in a nice nearring. It follows that N must contain a left identity.\nThe uniqueness of the left identity follows from Proposi- tion 3 (c).\nRecall that a nearring allows one to construct a nice error basis resembling the form of the generalized Pauli basis if and only if it is nice. In this section, we characterize all ﬁnite rings\nthat are nice. Furthermore, we characterize all nice nearrings in an even broader class of nearrings, the so-called distributively generated ﬁnite nearrings. Finally, we show that any ﬁnite nearﬁeld is nice.\nAn element d of a nearring N is called distributive if and only if\nholds for all x, y in N . A nearring N is called distributively generated if and only if its set of distributive elements generate the additive group (N, +). Obviously, any distributive near- ring is distributively generated, but there exist distributively generated nearrings that are not distributive. We are going to characterize all distributively generated nearrings that are nice. We will recall some terminology from the theory of rings and their modules for this purpose.\nLet R be a ring. A left R-module I is called injective if and only if for any monomorphism g : A → B of left R- modules and any homomorphism h : A → I there exists a homomorphism h : B → I such that h = h ◦ g. In other words, the following diagram of R-modules commutes:\nA ring R is called left self-injective if and only if the left R-module R R is injective. By a result of Baer a ring R is left self-injective if and only if any homomorphism from a left ideal J can be extended to a homomorphism from R to itself.\nA ring is called a quasi-Frobenius ring if and only if it is a left-noetherian and left self-injective ring. Equivalently, we could have deﬁned a quasi-Frobenius ring as a right-noetherian right self-injective ring. Thus, the apparent dichotomy between left and right in the deﬁnition of a quasi-Frobenius ring is irrelevant.\nLet M be a left R-module over a ring R. The socle soc(M ) of the module M is deﬁned as the sum of all minimal submodules of M . The Jacobson radical rad(M ) of the module M is deﬁned as the intersection of all maximal submodules of M . The Jacobson radical rad(R) of a ring R is deﬁned as rad(R) = rad( R R).\nAn artinian ring R is called Frobenius if and only if it is quasi-Frobenius and soc( R R) = R (R/rad R). For example, a) Any semisimple ring is a Frobenius ring.\nb) Let R be a Dedekind ring and J a nonzero ideal, then R/J is a Frobenius ring.\nc) In particular, Z/nZ is a Frobenius ring for all integers n > 1.\nd) Let k be a ﬁeld and G a ﬁnite group. Then the group ring kG is a Frobenius ring.\nTheorem 7. A distributively generated nearring is nice if and only if it is a ﬁnite Frobenius ring.\nProof: A ﬁnite Frobenius ring is evidently a distributively generated nearring. Moreover, a ﬁnite Frobenius ring has\na generating character, see [6], [15]. Thus, it follows from Lemma 2 that a ﬁnite Frobenius ring is nice. Therefore, we can conclude that a ﬁnite Frobenius ring is a nice distributively generated nearring.\nConversely, let N be a distributively generated nice near- ring. By Proposition 6 it contains a unique left identity. Any distributively generated nearring with unique left identity must have an identity, see [13, Theorem 6.7(b)]. By Propo- sition 3 (b), N is abelian. A distributively generated abelian nearring is a ring []. However, a ring is nice if and only if it is a ﬁnite Frobenius ring.\nProof: Let N be a ﬁnite nearﬁeld. For elements a, b in N , we can deﬁne a map a,b : N → N by a,b (x) = ax − bx. This map is injective when a and b are distinct elements. Indeed, seeking a contradiction, suppose that x and y are distinct elements in N such that a,b (x) = a,b (y), then a(x − y) = b(x − y); since nearﬁelds are cancellative, this would imply a = b, contradicting the fact that a and b must be distinct.\nLet χ be a nontrivial character of (N, +). Seeking a contradiction, suppose that χ is not a generating character. Then there exist distinct a, b in N such that χ a = χ b . In other words, χ(ax) = χ(bx) must holds for all x in N . Multiplying with χ(−bx), we obtain χ(ax − bx) = χ( a,b (x)) = 1 for all x in N . Since a,b is an injective function, this means that all elements of N must be in the kernel of χ, but this contradicts the fact that χ is a nontrivial character.\nIn this paper, we introduced a class of nice error bases that forms a very natural generalization of the generalized Pauli basis. The error bases are formed by exploiting the additive and multiplicative structure of nice error bases. We called nearring nice if and only if it is capable to support such a nice error basis. We have shown that any nice nearﬁeld is a nice nearring. Furthermore, we have shown that a ring is nice if and only if it is a ﬁnite Frobenius ring. More generally, we have been able to determine which distributively generated ﬁnite nearrings are nice.\nIn applications to quantum error-correction codes, one can form nice error bases by tensoring them. In the homogeneous case, where a nice error bases is tensored with itself n times, one can characterize which pairs of matrix elements commute in terms of a character that contains as an argument a difference dot products, just as in the case of the generalized Pauli group. The error bases that have been introduced here were designed with a view toward such applications in coding theory. The advantage is that one can now work in any dimension, not just in dimensions that are a power of a prime.\nI thank C.P. Maxson for his insightful comments on a draft of this paper.
