D. Wyner [9]. It is a kind of degraded broadcast channel. The wiretapper knows the encoding scheme used at the trans- mitter and the decoding scheme used at the legitimate receiver. The object is to describe the rate of reliable communication from the transmitter to the legitimate receiver, subject to a constraint of the equivocation to the wiretapper.\nAfter the publication of A. D. Wyner\u2019s work, I. Csisz´ ar and J. K¨orner [5] investigated a more general situation: the broadcast channels with conﬁdential messages. It is clear that A. D. Wyner\u2019s wiretap channel is a special case of the model of I. Csisz´ ar and J. K¨orner, in a manner that the main channel is less noisy than the wiretap channel. In addition, the secrecy capacity of the non-degraded wiretap channel was also formulated in [5], which provides the best transmission rate with perfect secrecy. Based on A. D. Wyner\u2019s work, S. K. Leung-Yan-Cheong and M. E. Hellman studied the Gaussian wiretap channel (GWC) [4], and showed that its secrecy capacity was the difference between the main channel capacity and the overall wiretap channel capacity (the cascade of main channel and wiretap channel). Recently, C. Mitrpant et al. [7] and Y. Chen et al. [3] studied wiretap channel with noncausal channel state information, where both of them focused on achievable regions. In addition, N. Merhav [8] studied a speciﬁc wiretap channel, and obtained the capacity region, where both the legitimate receiver and the wiretapper have access to some leaked symbols from the source, but the\nchannels for the wiretapper are more noisy than the legitimate receiver, which shares a secret key with the encoder.\nIt is a well-known fact that the feedback does not increase the capacity of a discrete memoryless channel (DMC). How- ever, does the feedback increase the secrecy capacity of the wiretap channel? To solve this problem, R. Ahlswede and N. Cai studied the wiretap channels with noiseless feedback from the legitimate receiver [1], where both upper bound and lower bound of the secrecy capacity were provided. The lower bound is proved to be tight, while the upper bound is only tight for some special cases. Speciﬁcally, for the degraded wiretap channel, the secrecy capacity satisﬁes\nwhere X, Y and Z are input of the main channel, output of the main channel and output of the wiretap channel, respectively. In addition, the wiretap channel with noisy feedback was studied in [6], and the wiretap channel with secure rate-limited feedback was studied in [2], and both of them focused on bounds of the secrecy capacity.\nIn this paper, we study the model of non-degraded wiretap channel with noiseless feedback, see Figure 1. In this model, the i-th time input of the main channel X i depends not only on the message W , but also on the previous outputs of the main channel Y i −1 . The wiretapper can observe X i via a wiretap channel, see Figure 1.\nThe capacity region considering transmission rate and equivocation, is determined for the model of Figure 1. Further- more, the secrecy capacity of this model is formulated, which provides the best transmission rate with perfect secrecy.\nThe reminder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we present the basic deﬁnitions and the main result of the capacity region (including the secrecy capacity). In Section III, we prove the converse half of Theorem 1. The direct half of Theorem 1 is proved in Section IV. Section V shows the capacity regions of two special cases. Final conclusions are presented in Section VI.\n? \n? Transmitter\nFig. 1: The non-degraded wiretap channel with noiseless feedback\nThroughout the paper, random variab1es, sample values and alphabets are denoted by capital letters, lower case letters and calligraphic letters, respectively. A similar convention is applied to the random vectors and their sample values. For example, U N denotes a random N -vector (U 1 , ..., U N ), and u N = (u 1 , ..., u N ) is a speciﬁc vector value in U N , which is the N th Cartesian power of U. Let p V (v) denote the probability mass function P r {V = v}, v ∈ V.\nIn this section, a description of the model of Figure 1 is given by Deﬁnition 1 to Deﬁnition 5. The achievable (R, R e ) pair is deﬁned in Deﬁnition 6, and the capacity region R composed of all achievable (R, R e ) pairs is characterized in Theorem 1.\nDeﬁnition 1: (channel encoder) The message W is uni- formly distributed over W. The feedback Y i −1 is the previous i-1 time output of the main channel, and it is available at the channel encoder. At the i-th time, the inputs of the channel encoder are W and Y i −1 , while the output is X i . The i-th time channel encoder is a mapping f i : W × Y i −1 → X i .\nDeﬁnition 2: (main channel) The main channel is a DMC with ﬁnite input alphabet X , ﬁnite output alphabet Y, and transition probability Q M (y |x), where x ∈ X , y ∈ Y. Q M (y N |x N ) =\nQ M (y n |x n ). The input of the main channel is X N , while the output is Y N .\nDeﬁnition 3: (wiretap channel) The wiretap channel is also a DMC with ﬁnite input alphabet X , ﬁnite output alphabet Z, and transition probability Q W (z |x), where y ∈ Y, x ∈ X . The input and output of the wiretap channel are X N and Z N , respectively. The equivocation to the wiretapper is deﬁned as\n∆ = 1 N\nThe perfect secrecy is achieved when H(W |Z N ) = H(W ). Note that, W → X N → (Y N , Z N ) and Y N → X N → Z N\nDeﬁnition 4: (the relation of the main channel and the wiretap channel ) Similar to the deﬁnitions in [5], the relation \u201cthe main channel is more capable than the wiretap channel\u201d is characterized by I(X N ; Z N ) ≤ I(X N ; Y N ), and otherwise\nwe say that the wiretap channel is more capable than the main channel.\nDeﬁnition 5: (decoder) The decoder is a mapping f D : Y N → W, with input Y N and output ˆ W = f D (Y N ). Let P e be the error probability, and it is deﬁned as P r {W ̸= ˆ W }.\nIn the following paragraph, the achievable (R, R e ) pair is deﬁned in Deﬁnition 6, and the capacity region R composed of all achievable (R, R e ) pairs is characterized in Theorem 1.\nDeﬁnition 6: (achievable (R, R e ) pair in the model of Figure 1 ) A pair (R, R e ) (where R, R e > 0) is called achievable if, for any ϵ > 0, there exists an encoder-decoder (N, ∆, P e ) such that\nOur problem in the model of Figure 1 is to characterize the set R of all achievable (R, R e ) pairs. The following Theorem 1 gives a characterization of the set R, which is proved in the remaining sections. The secrecy capacity in the new model of Figure 1 is deﬁned in Remark 1 (see (2.4)), which is calculated by the formula (2.5).\nTheorem 1: \u2022 If the main channel is more capable than the wiretap channel, the capacity region R, as deﬁned above, is equal to R ∗ , where\n\u2022 If the wiretap channel is more capable than the main channel, the capacity region R, as deﬁned above, is equal to R ∗∗ , where\nR ∗∗ = {(R, R e ) : 0 ≤ R ≤ I(X; Y ), 0 ≤ R e ≤ R,\nRemark 1: There are some notes on Theorem 1, see the following.\n\u2022 The region R is convex, and it is easy to be checked by using a switch function, thus the proof is omitted here.\nis called secrecy capacity in the model of Figure 1, and note that R e = R implies perfect secrecy. Furthermore, for case 1, C \u2032 s satisﬁes\nThe proof is obvious from (2.4) and Theorem 1, thus it is omitted here.\n\u2022 If the wiretap channel is more capable than the main channel, the secrecy capacity of the non-degraded wiretap channel without feedback reduces to zero. However, for the feedback model, the secrecy capacity still satisﬁes (2.6), and this is because the noiseless feedback is used as a secret key shared by the transmitter and the legitimate receiver, while the wiretapper does not know the key. Therefore, by using feedback, the secrecy capacity is enhanced.\n\u2022 For the degraded wiretap channel, R. Ahlswede and N. Cai [1] proved that the secrecy capacity satisﬁes C s = min max {H(Y |Z), I(X; Y )}, and it is coincident with the above (2.5).\n\u2022 Because of the restriction Y → X → Z, the conception \u201cnon-degraded wiretap channel\u201d of this paper is included in the \u201cgeneral wiretap channel\u201d. The capacity region of the general wiretap channel with noiseless feedback is still unknown.\nIn this section, we establish the converse theorem. Suppose (R, R e ) ∈ R, i.e., for any given ϵ > 0, there exists an encoder- decoder (N, ∆, P e ) such that\nFor both cases, the proof of R ≤ I(X; Y ) is obvious, and it is omitted here. The proof of 0 ≤ R e ≤ R is from\nTherefore, it only needs to prove that R e ≤ H(Y |Z) (the main channel is more capable than the wiretap channel) and R e ≤ H(Y |X) (the wiretap channel is more capable than the main channel), see the following.\nwhere δ(P e ) = h(P e ) + P e log( |W| − 1). \u2022 Proof of R e ≤ H(Y |Z)\nFor the case that the main channel is more capable than the wiretap channel, we have\n∆ = 1 N\n= \t 1 N (I(W ; Y N |Z N ) + δ(P e )) ≤ 1 N (H(Y N |Z N ) + δ(P e ))\nwhere (1) is from (3.1), (2) is from Q is a random variable uniformly distributed over {1, ..., N} and Q is independent with Y N , Z N , and (3) is from the deﬁnitions Y Y Q and Z Z Q .\nLetting ϵ → 0, R e ≤ H(Y |Z) is proved. \u2022 Proof of R e ≤ H(Y |X)\nFor the case that the wiretap channel is more capable than the main channel, we have\n∆ = 1 N\n= \t 1 N\n= \t 1 N (H(Y N |X N ) + δ(P e ) + I(X N ; W |Y N )) ≤ 1 N (H(Y N |X N ) + δ(P e ) + H(W |Y N ))\n≤ (e) 1 N (H(Y N |X N ) + 2δ(P e )) ≤ (f ) H(Y Q |X Q , Q) + 2δ(P e )\nwhere (a) is from W → X N → Z N , (b) is from Fano\u2019s inequality (δ(P e ) = h(P e ) + P e log( |W| − 1)), (c) is from the fact that for case 2, the wiretap channel is more capable than the main channel, i.e., I(X N ; Z N ) ≥ I(X N ; Y N ), (d) is from X N is a function of W and Y N , (e) is from Fano\u2019s inequality, (f) is from Q is a random variable uniformly distributed over {1, ..., N} and Q is independent with Y N , X N , and (g) is from the deﬁnitions Y Y Q and X X Q .\nLetting ϵ → 0, R e ≤ H(Y |X) is proved. The converse part of Theorem 1 is proved.\nIn this section, we establish the direct part of Theorem 1(about existence). The proof is considered for the following cases.\n\u2022 Case 1: I(X, Y ) > I(X; Z). \u2022 Case 2: I(X, Y ) ≤ I(X; Z).\nGiven a pair (R, R e ), choose a probability mass function p X (x) such that 0 ≤ R e ≤ R, 0 ≤ R ≤ I(X; Y ) and R e ≤ H(Y |Z) or R e ≤ H(Y |X). The message W is uniformly distributed over W, let ∥W∥ = 2 N R .\nGenerate a set R K composed of 2 N I(X;Y ) sequences of x N , and each of them is i.i.d. generated according to p X (x). Meanwhile, generate a mapping g f : Y N → W. Deﬁne a random variable K = g f (Y N ), which is uniformly distributed over W, and K is independent with W . In addition, divide the set R K into ∥W∥ subsets, and each subset R K,i (1 ≤ i ≤ ∥W∥) corresponds to a speciﬁc value in W. There are 2 N (I(X;Y ) −R) sequences in each subset. Reveal the mapping g f to the legitimate receiver, wiretapper and the transmitter.\nWe use the block Markov coding method. The random vectors X N , Y N , and Z N consist of n blocks of length N . The messages for n blocks is\nwhere W i (2 ≤ i ≤ n) are i.i.d. random variables uniformly distributed over W.\nIn the ﬁrst block, the transmitter randomly choose a se- quence x N from R K to transmit. In the i-th block (2 ≤ i ≤ n), the transmitter receives the output y N of the i-1-th block, then he computes k i = g f (y N ) ∈ W. For a given w i , the transmitter randomly choose a sequence x N from the subset R K,i=w i ⊕k i to transmit, where ⊕ is the modulo addition over W. Note that k i is a speciﬁc value for the random variable K used at the i-th block (2 ≤ i ≤ n). Since K is independent with W i , and K, W i are uniformly distributed in W, then we have that K ⊕ W i is independent with K and W i .\n(Case 1) For case 1, there are 2 N I(X;Y ) codewords of x N , and 2 N I(X;Y ) > 2 N I(X;Z) , therefore, the wiretapper can not decode x N correctly with error probability tending to zero. However, he can guess the speciﬁc vector y N from the conditional typical set T N [Y |Z]δ (z N ), because the probability that y N ∈ T N [Y |Z]δ (z N ) tends to 1, as δ → ∞. By using the property of strong AEP, we know that the number of\n(Case 2) Since I(X, Y ) ≤ I(X; Z), the wiretapper can decode the transmitted x N correctly with error probability tending to zero. Therefore, for the given x N and z N , he can guess the speciﬁc vector y N in the conditional typical set T N [Y |X,Z]δ \u2032 (x N , z N ), because the probability that y N ∈ T N [Y |X,Z]δ \u2032 (x N , z N ) tends to 1, as N → ∞. By using the property of strong AEP, we know that the number of y N ∈\nwhere (a) is from the fact that given X, Y is independent with Z.\nFor the two cases, the rate of the message W n is deﬁned as\nnN = (a) lim\n(1 − 1 n\nThe decoding scheme for the two cases is obvious. In the i-th block, for a given y N , the receiver tries to ﬁnd a codeword x N such that (x N , y N ) ∈ T N XY (ϵ), then by using the secret key K i , he can decode the transmitted message as ˆ w.\nBy using the above deﬁnitions and (4.2), it is easy to verify that lim N →∞ log ∥W∥ N = R. Then, observing the construction of X N , it is easy to see that the codewords of X N is upper- bounded by 2 N I(X;Y ) . Therefore, from the standard channel coding theorem, for any given ϵ > 0 and sufﬁciently large N , we have P e ≤ ϵ. It remains to show that lim N →∞ ∆ ≥ R e , see the following.\nLet Z i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) be the output of the wiretap channel for block i, and let Z n = (Z 1 , ..., Z n ), Z i = (Z 1 , ..., Z i , Z n i+1 = (Z i+1 , ..., Z n (1 ≤ i ≤ n). Analogously, let Y n = (Y 1 , ..., Y n ). Deﬁne X n = (X 1 , ..., X n ).\nnN ≥ lim\nwhere (a) is from W i → (Z i , Z i −1 ) → (W i −1 , Z i −2 , Z n i+1 ) is a Markov chain, (b) is from W i → (W i ⊕ K, Z i −1 ) → Z i is a Markov chain, (c) follows from the fact that the wiretapper can guess the speciﬁc vector y N in the conditional typical set T N [Y |Z]δ (z N ), and K ⊕W i is independent with K and W i , and K is uniformly distributed over W.\nwhere (d) is from Z i → (W i ⊕ K, Z i −1 , X i −1 ) → W i , (e) follows from the fact that the wiretapper can guess the speciﬁc vector y N in the conditional typical set T N [Y |X,Z]δ \u2032 (x N , z N ), and K ⊕ W i is independent with K and W i , and K is uniformly distributed over W, and (f) is from the fact that given X, Y is independent with Z.\nIn this subsection, we assume that the wiretap channel is noiseless, and the main channel is a BSC with cross-over probability p 0 . The capacity region of this case is characterized as follows.\n= H(Y ) − H(Y |X) ≤ 1 − h(p 0 ), 0 ≤ R e ≤ R,\nIn this subsection, we assume that the wiretap channel is a BSC with cross-over probability p 1 , and the main channel is noiseless. The capacity region of this case is characterized as follows.\nR ∗∗ = {(R, R e ) : 0 ≤ R ≤ I(X; Y ) = H(X) ≤ 1,\nR e ≤ H(Y |Z) = H(X|Z) = H(Z|X) + H(X) − H(Z) ≤ h(p 1 ) }.\nIn this paper, we study the model of non-degraded wiretap channel with noiseless feedback. The capacity region consid- ering transmission rate and equivocation, is determined for this new model. Furthermore, the secrecy capacity is formulated, which provides the best transmission rate with perfect secrecy. Moreover, we ﬁnd that even if the wiretap channel is more capable than the main channel, with the help of the feedback as a shared secret key, the perfect secrecy can also be achieved.\nHowever, for the case that the wiretap channel is more capable than the main channel, the converse proof of The- orem 1 depends on the deterministic property of the channel encoder. Since the randomization may increase the capacity- equivocation region, generalizing the result of this paper according to a random channel encoder is our future work.\nThis work was supported by the German Research Foun- dation DFG, the National 973 Project of China under Grant 2012CB316100 and the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 60972033 and 60832001."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"R.
