When the channel noise is bellow a certain threshold, a bigger length essentially means a higher resolution when estimating the sent value. On the other hand, if the folds of the curve come too close, this threshold will be small and the mean squared error (mse) will be dominated by larger errors as consequence of decoding to the wrong fold. Explicit constructions of curves for analog source-channel coding were presented, for example, in [8] and [9].\nIn this work, we will consider spherical curves in the 2N - dimensional Euclidean space. We develop an extension of the construction presented in [8] to a set of curves on layers of ﬂat tori. Our approach explores geometrical properties of spherical codes and projections of N -dimensional lattices. In the scheme presented here, homogeneity and low decoding complexity properties were preserved whereas the total length can be meaningfully increased.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we in- troduce some mathematical background used in our approach. In Section III we state the problem, while in Section IV we present a scheme to design piecewise homogeneous curves on the Euclidean sphere and describe the encoding/decoding process. In Section V we derive a scaled version of the Lifting Construction [6] suitable to our problem and present some examples and length comparisons with some previous constructions.\nThe unit sphere S 2N −1 ⊂ R 2N can be foliated with ﬂat tori [1], [7] as follows. For each unit vector ccc = (c 1 , c 2 , .., c N ) ∈ R N , c i > 0, and u u u = (u 1 , u 2 , . . . , u N ) ∈ R N , let Φ ccc : R N → R 2N be deﬁned by\nThis periodic function Φ ccc is a local isometry on its image, the torus T ccc , a ﬂat N -dimensional surface contained in the unit sphere S 2N −1 . T ccc = Φ ccc (R N ) is also the image of the hyperbox:\nNote also that each vector of S 2N −1 belongs to one, and only one, of these ﬂat tori if we consider also the degenerated cases where some ccc i may vanish. Thus we say that the family of ﬂat tori T ccc and their degenerations, with ccc = (c 1 , c 2 , .., c N ),\nccc = 1, c i ≥ 0, deﬁned above is a foliation on the unit sphere of S 2N −1 ⊂ R 2N .\nIt can be shown (Proposition 1 in [7]) that the minimum distance between two points, one in each ﬂat torus T bbb and T ccc , is\nThe distance between two points on the same torus T ccc given by\nis bounded in terms of u u u − vvv by the following proposition. Proposition 1. [7] Let c = c = c = (c 1 , c 2 , .., c N ), ccc = 1, and let u u u, vvv ∈ P ccc . Let ∆ = u u u − vvv and δ = Φ ccc (u u u) − Φ ccc (vvv) . Then\nAs pointed out in [8], some important properties of a curve from a communication point of view are its stretch and small- ball radius . Given a curve sss : [a, b] → R N , the Voronoi region V (x) of a point sss(x) is the set of all points in R N which are closer to sss(x) than to any other point of the curve. If H(x) denotes the hyperplane orthogonal to the curve at sss(x), then the maximal small-ball radius of sss is the largest r > 0 such that B r (sss(x)) ∩ H(x) ⊂ V (x) for all x ∈ [a, b], where B r (sss(x)) is the Euclidean ball of radius r centered at sss(x). Intuitively this means that the \u201ctube\u201d of radius r placed along the curve does not intersect itself. The stretch S(x) is the function ˙sss(x) where ˙sss(x) is the derivative of sss(x). If ˙sss\ndoes not depend on x (as it is the case of the curves considered here) we will refer to the stretch as simply S. The length of a curve is given by b a S(x)dx. In this paper we will be interested in curves with large length and small-ball radius.\nThe underlying communication system we consider here is illustrated in Figure 1. Given an input real value x, within the unit interval [0, 1], the encoder maps x into a point sss(x) of a curve sss on S 2N −1 , which will be sent over an AWGN channel. By properly scaling the curve we guarantee that the transmitted energy is α 2 . The decoder will then compute an estimate for the sent value while trying to minimize the mean squared error (mse) E[(X − ˆ X) 2 ] of the process.\nFor the torus layers scheme, the unit interval will be partitioned into M intervals of different length, and each of them mapped into a curve on one of the layers. It is worth noticing that, for the special case M = 1, if we choose the torus associated to the vector c = 1 √ N (1, . . . , 1) to encode the information, then the scheme proposed here is exactly the one analysed in [8]. However, we are interested in the analysis for M > 1, in which case the curves to be presented outperform the ones presented in [8] (see also [6]) in terms of the tradeoff between length and small-ball radius.\nThe design of those curves in the next section is essentially divided in two parts. First, we choose a collection of tori on the surface of the Euclidean sphere S 2N −1 at least δ apart. The approach for doing this is via discrete spherical codes in R N . Second, we show a systematic way of constructing curves on each layer, via projection-lattices in R N −1 . Finally, we give a description of the whole signal locus and summarize the encoding process.\nGiven a ﬁxed small ball radius δ, the ﬁrst step of our approach is to deﬁne a collection T = {T 1 , T 2 , · · · , T M } of ﬂat tori on S 2N −1 such that the minimum distance (3) between any two of them is greater than 2δ. This step is equivalent to design a N -dimensional spherical code SC with minimum distance 2δ and consider just the points with non-negative coordinates.\nEach point ccc ∈ SC + deﬁnes a hyperbox P ccc (2) and hence a ﬂat torus T ccc in the unit sphere S 2N −1 .\nThere are several ways of constructing spherical codes that can be employed here, e.g. [3], [4] or even on layers of ﬂat tori as introduced in [7].\nLet T ccc be a torus represented by the vector ccc ∈ SC + as deﬁned in the previous section. On the surface of T ccc we will consider curves of the form:\nwhere C = diag(c 1 , . . . , c L ), ˆ u u u = u u uC = (c 1 u 1 , . . . , c N u N ), Φ ccc is given by (1) and x ∈ [0, 1].\nProvided that u u u ∈ Z N , gcd(u i ) = 1, those curves are closed (a type (u 1 , . . . , u N )-knot), and due to periodicity and local isometry properties of Φ ccc their lengths are 2π ˆ u u u . They are also the image through Φ ccc of the intersection between the set of lines W = ˆ u u ux + ˆ n n n : ˆ n n n = n n nC, n n n ∈ Z L and the box P ccc . For c = 1 √ N (1, . . . , 1), these are exactly the curves analysed in [8].\nLet r ccc (u u u) be the minimum distance between two different lines in W , then we have\nˆ u u ux − (ˆ u u uˆ x + ˆ n n n) = min\nmin x ˆ u u ux − ˆ n n n = min\nP ˆ u u u ⊥ (ˆ n n n) = min\nwhere P ˆ u u u ⊥ (ˆ n n n) denotes the orthogonal projection of ˆ n n n onto the hyperplane ˆ u u u ⊥ which is given by the standard projection formula\nLet Λ ccc = c 1 Z ⊕ . . . ⊕ c N Z be the rectangular lattice generated by matrix C, then r ccc (u u u) is the length of shortest non-zero vector of the projection 1 of Λ ccc onto ˆ u u u ⊥ . Due to\nEquation (4), the small-ball radius δ u u u,ccc of sss T c c c can be bounded in terms of r ccc (u u u) as follows:\nc i and c i > 0. Thus, for small values of δ u u u,ccc , we have δ u u u,ccc ≈ πr ccc (u u u). Our goal is to choose u u u in order to maximize r ccc (u u u). In addition, we also want to reach a contrary objective, which is the one of maximizing the arc length l u u u,ccc = 2π ˆ u u u of sss T c c c .\nIt is possible to show (Proposition 1.2.9. in [5]) that the density of the lattice P ˆ u ⊥ (Λ c ), the projection of Λ c onto ˆ u ⊥ , is given by:\nwhere ∆ N −1 is the density of the best lattice in dimension (N − 1) and V N −1 is the volume of the (N − 1)-dimensional unit sphere. For the case when all entries of c are equal, Λ c is equivalent to Z N and it was shown in [6] that we can make the above bound as tight as we want. We will show in Section V that this is also true for an arbitrary c i.e., that projections of the rectangular lattice Λ ccc can also yield dense lattice packings and therefore we can construct curves on the ﬂat torus with the parameters arbitrary close to this bound.\non the ﬂat torus T ccc and the line segment given by vvv(x) = xvvv, = x(2πu 1 c 1 , 2πu 2 c 2 ), u 1 , u 2 ∈ Z and 0 ≤ x ≤ 1. The curve sss T c (x) will be the composition Φ(vvv(x)) and we have\nThis curve in R 4 will turn around u 1 -times the circle obtained by its projection on the ﬁrst two coordinates, whereas turning around u 2 -times the circle of radius c 2 given by its last two coordinates (a type (u 1 , u 2 ) knot on the ﬂat torus T ccc ). For this case, we can calculate the exact small-ball radius δ as d(Φ(αvvv ⊥ ), Φ(0)) where vvv ⊥ = (−2πc 2 u 2 , 2πc 1 u 1 ) and α = πc 1 c 2 / vvv 2 . In Figure 2 it is illustrated the curve (u 1 , u 2 ) = (4, 5), with c 1 > c 2 .\nLet T = {T 1 , . . . , T M } be a collection of M tori as designed in Section IV-A. For each one of these tori, let sss T k (x) = Φ(2πˆ u u u k x), (k = 1, 2, . . . , M ) be the curve on T k , determined by the vector ˆ u u u k (5) and consider L = M j=1 l j , where l k is the length of sss T k .\nNow split the unit interval [0, 1] into M pieces according to the length of each curve:\nThe stretch of sss will be constant and equal its total length L and the small-ball radius of sss is the minimum small-ball radius δ of the curves sss T k , provided that the distance between any pair of torus in T is at least 2δ.\nTo encode a value x within [0, 1] we apply the map (12). The signal locus will be a set of M closed curves, each one lying on a torus layer T k and deﬁned by a vector u u u k . This whole process is illustrated in Figure 2.\nIf the source is uniformly distributed over [0, 1], the en- coding process presented above is a proper one, since all subintervals will be equally stretched. For other applications, however, it could be worth considering another partition.\nGiven a received vector yyy ∈ R 2N , the maximum likelihood decoding is ﬁnding ˆ x such that:\nSince exactly solving this problem is computationally ex- pensive we focus on a suboptimal decoder.\nThe process of ﬁnding the closest layer involves a N -dimensional spherical decoding of γγγ = (γ 1 , γ 2 , · · · , γ N ), which has complexity\nLet ccc i = (c i1 , c i2 , · · · , c iN ) be the closest point in ∈ SC + to γγγ and\nThe Lifting Construction was proposed in [6] as a solution to the problem of ﬁnding dense lattices which are equivalent to orthogonal projections of Z N along integer vectors (\u201cfat- strut\u201d problem). In this section we adapt that strategy in order to construct projections of the lattice Λ ccc which approximate any (N − 1) dimensional lattice (hence the densest one) with the objective of ﬁnding curves in R N approaching the bound (9). We adopt here the lattice terms as in [2]. For our purposes, the proximity measure for lattices will be the distance between their Gram matrices, as in [6]. This notion measures how close a lattice is to another one up to congruence transformations (rotations or reﬂections).\nThe dual of a lattice Λ ∈ R N is the set Λ ∗ = {xxx ∈ span(Λ) : x x x, yyy ∈ Z ∀yyy ∈ Λ} where span(Λ) is the subspace spanned\nby a basis of Λ. Now let Λ ccc = c 1 Z ⊕ . . . ⊕ c N Z be the rectangular lattice generated by the diagonal matrix C (and with Gram matrix CC t = C 2 ). By scaling Λ ccc , we can assume that c 1 = 1. With this condition, if P u u u ⊥ (Λ ccc ) ∗ denotes the dual of the projection of Λ ccc onto a vector ˆ u u u = (1, u 2 c 2 . . . , u N c N ) ( u i ∈ Z), then a generator matrix for P ˆ u u u ⊥ (Λ ccc ) ∗ is given by\n   \n−u 2 1/c 2 0 . . . 0 −u 3 0 1/c 3 . . . 0\n   \nwhat can be derived as a consequence of Prop. 1.3.4 [5]. In what follows we derive a general construction of projections such that P u u u ⊥ is arbitrarily close to a target lattice Λ ∈ R N −1 . Theorem 1. Let Λ ccc = Z ⊕ c 2 Z . . . ⊕ c N Z, c i ∈ R. Let Λ be a target lattice in R N −1 and consider a lower triangular generator matrix L ∗ = (l ∗ ij ) for Λ ∗ . If Λ ∗ w , w ∈ N is the sequence of lattices generated by the matrices\n    \n⌊wl ∗ 11 ⌋ \t 1 c 2 \t . . . \t . . . \t 0 ⌊wl ∗ 21 ⌋ ⌊wl ∗ 22 c 2 ⌋ c 2 \t . . . \t . . . \t 0\n    \n(14) then:\n(i) L ∗ w = P ˆ u u u ⊥ (Λ) ∗ for some ˆ u u u ∈ R N and (ii) (1/w 2 )L ∗ w L ∗t w → L ∗ L ∗t as w → ∞.\nIn other words, for large w, Λ will be approximated (in the sense of the Gram matrices) by projections of Λ ccc .\nProof: Through applying elementary (integer) operations on L ∗ w we can put it on form (13) for some integers u 2 , . . . , u n depending on w, hence L ∗ w is a generator matrix for P ˆ u u u ⊥ (Λ) ∗ , proving the ﬁrst statement. For the second statement, we clearly have (1/w)L ∗ w → [L ∗ 000] as w → ∞, where 000 is the (n−1)×n all-zero column vector. Therefore, (1/w 2 )L ∗ w L ∗t w → [L ∗ 000] [L ∗ 000] t = L ∗ L ∗t .\nExample 2. Consider the hexagonal lattice [2], which is the best packing in two dimensions and is equivalent to its dual. One of its generator matrix is\nWe apply the construction above and reduce, through ele- mentary operations, the matrix L ∗ w in order to put it on form (13). After re-scaling the rectangular lattice Λ ccc , we ﬁnd the sequence of vectors\nThe projections of c 1 Z ⊕ c 2 Z ⊕ c 3 Z onto ˆ u u u ⊥ w will be, up to equivalence, arbitrarily close to A 2 when w → ∞.\nHere we compare our approach of construct curves on torus layers with the curves constructed in [6] and [8] in terms of length for given small-ball radii. Given δ > 0, we ﬁrst consider a set of ﬂat tori associated to a spherical code in R 3 , with minimum distance greater than 2δ, as described in Section IV-A. Through the ﬁrst inequality of (8), for each torus, we can ﬁnd r ccc in order to guarantee that the curves on the ﬂat tori will have small-ball radius at least δ (this is also done in the case of the curves on the torus c = 1/\nthen look for the larger element of the sequence of vectors that produces a projection with minimum distance at least r ccc .\nFig. 3: Comparison between diferent approaches in terms of small-ball radius δ and arc-length S.\nIn Figure 3, the ﬁrst curve from the bottom to the top represents the exponential sequence [8]. The second one is obtained by directly applying the Lifting Construction [6] to the hexagonal lattice and the last one displays the total length associated to our scheme.\nThe problem of transmitting a continuous alphabet source over an AWGN channel was considered through an approach based on curves designed in layers of ﬂat tori on the surface of a (2N )-dimensional Euclidean sphere. This approach ex- plores connections with constructions of spherical codes and is related to the problem of ﬁnding dense projections of the lattice c 1 Z ⊕ . . . ⊕ c N Z .\nThis work is a generalization of both the scheme proposed in [8] and the Lifting Construction in [6]. As a consequence, our scheme compares favorably to previous works in terms of the tradeoff between total length and small-ball radius, which is a proper ﬁgure of merit for this communication system.\nIn spite of the improvements in terms of length versus small- ball radius, the constructiveness, homogeneity and overall complexity of the decoding algorithm are features preserved from [8].\nThe authors would like to thank the Centre Interfacultaire Bernoulli (CIB) at EPFL where part of this work was devel- oped, during the special semester on Combinatorial, Algebraic and Algorithmic Aspects of Coding Theory."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"S.
