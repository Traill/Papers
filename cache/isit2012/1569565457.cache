The classical version of this topic was discussed by [2], [6], [7], [9]. The quantum version is mainly treated by Renner[8] and his collaborators with using universal 2 hash function. Indeed, a universal 2 hash function can be imple- mented with small amount of calculation. As is shown by Renner[8], when the classical random variable is correlated with eavesdropper\u2019s quantum state, applying a universal 2 hash function as a privacy ampliﬁcation process, we obtain a secret random variable.\nWhen the size of generated ﬁnal random variable is sufﬁ- ciently small, the ﬁnal bits are almost independent of eaves- dropper\u2019s quantum state. Then, it is needed to evaluate the leaked information of the protocol using a universal 2 hash function. In order to evaluate the secrecy, Renner[8] showed a privacy ampliﬁcation theorem under the trace norm distance with the conditional R´enyi entropy of order 2. Combining this theorem to the smoothing method, he provided the evaluation for the secrecy of ﬁnal random variable.\nIn this paper, we propose a new security criterion for leaked information and the difference from the uniform distribution by modifying the quantum mutual information. Due to the Pinsker inequality, the criterion bounds the universal compos- ability. Using the conditional R´enyi entropy of order 1 + s, we propose other types of privacy ampliﬁcation theorems under the above criterion. The fundamental theorem for this purpose is derived by extending classical privacy ampliﬁcation theorems obtained by [13], [14]. Using one of these theorems, we derive an exponential decreasing rate of the criterion. That is, when the extracted key rate is less than the conditional entropy, the criterion goes to zero exponentially. Then, we\nderive an exponential decreasing rate for leaked information, whose commutative case is the same as that by [13]. Further, using the Pinsker inequality, we apply our result to the criterion for the trace norm distance. When the extracted key rate is larger than the conditional entropy, the leaked information does not go to zero. In this case, we focus on the minimum conditional entropy rate. The rate is called the equivocation rate [3] and the quantum version has not been treated until now. Then, we derive the equivocation rate as by treating the minimum leaked information rate.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we prepare quantum versions of information quantities. In Section III, we derive the exponents of leaked information when the key generation rate is less than the conditional entropy rate. In Section IV, we derive the equivocation rate as the minimum conditional entropy for a given key generation rate.\nIn order to treat leaked information after universal 2 privacy ampliﬁcation in the quantum setting, we prepare several infor- mation quantities in a composite system H a ⊗ H E , in which, H a is a classical system spanned by the basis {|a }. When the composite state is ρ = a P (a)|a a| ⊗ ρ a , the von Neumann entropies and Renyi entropies are given as\nwith s ∈ R and ρ E = Tr A ρ. When we focus on the total system of a given density ρ, H(A, E|ρ) and H 1+s (A, E|ρ) are simpliﬁed to H(ρ) and H 1+s (ρ).\nTwo kinds of quantum versions of the conditional entropy and conditional Renyi entropy are given for s ∈ R:\nThe quantity H 1+s (A|E|ρ) is used for the exponential de- creasing rate for the security criterion in Section III while H ∗ 1+s (A|E|ρ) is used for our derivation of the equivocation rate in Section IV. Indeed, while the quantity H ∗ 2 (A|E|ρ) is the same as the quantity H 2 (A|E|ρ) given in [8] and the quantity H 2 (A|E|ρ) given in [11], the quantity H ∗ 1+s (A|E|ρ) is different from the quantity H 1+s (A|E|ρ) given in [11] with 0 < s < 1.\ns → sH ∗ 1+s (A|E|ρ) are concave and 0H 1 (A|E|ρ) = 0H 1 (A|E|ρ) = 0, H 1+s (A|E|ρ) and H ∗ 1+s (A|E|ρ)\nare monotone decreasing for s \t ∈ \t R. Since lim s→∞ H ∗ 1+s (A|E|ρ) coincides with the min entropy H min (A|E|ρ) := − log I A ⊗ (ρ E ) −1/2 ρI A ⊗ (ρ E ) −1/2 , H ∗ 1+s (A|E|ρ) ≥ H min (A|E|ρ). Since H 2 (A|E|ρ) =\n− log Tr ρ(ρ 1/2 (I A ⊗ ρ E ) −1 ρ 1/2 ), we have H 1+s (A|E|ρ) ≥ H 2 (A|E|ρ) ≥ − log (ρ 1/2 (I A ⊗ ρ E ) −1 ρ 1/2 ) \t =\n− log I A ⊗ (ρ E ) −1/2 ρI A ⊗ (ρ E ) −1/2 = H min (A|E|ρ) for s ∈ (0, 1]. Further, since lim s→0 H 1+s (A|E|ρ) = H(A|E|ρ) and lim s→0 H ∗ 1+s (A|E|ρ) = H(A|E|ρ), we have\nH(A|E|ρ) ≥ H 1+s (A|E|ρ), \t (1) H(A|E|ρ) ≥ H ∗ 1+s (A|E|ρ) \t (2)\nThen, the correlation between A and H E can be evaluated by two kinds of quantum versions of the mutual information\nI(A : E|ρ) := D(ρ ρ A ⊗ ρ E ) \t (3) I(A : E|ρ) := D(ρ ρ A ⊗ ρ E ) \t (4)\nD(ρ σ) := Tr ρ(log ρ − log σ) \t (5) D(ρ σ) := Tr ρ log(σ −1/2 ρσ −1/2 ). \t (6)\nBy using the completely mixed state ρ A mix on A, two kinds of quantum versions of the mutual information can be modiﬁed to\n= I(A : E|ρ) + D(ρ A ρ A mix ) \t (7) I (A : E|ρ) := D(ρ ρ A mix ⊗ ρ E ), \t (8)\nI(A : E|ρ) ≤ I (A : E|ρ) \t (9) I(A : E|ρ) ≤ I (A : E|ρ) \t (10)\nH(A|E|ρ) = −I (A : E|ρ) + log |A| \t (11) H(A|E|ρ) = −I (A : E|ρ) + log |A|. \t (12)\nIndeed, the quantity I(A : E|ρ A,E ) represents the amount of information leaked to E, and the remaining quantity D(ρ A ρ A mix ) describes the difference of the random number A from the uniform random number. So, if the quantity I (A : E|ρ A,E ) is small, we can conclude that the random number A has less correlation with E and is close to the uniform random number. In particular, if the quantity I (A : E|ρ A,E ) goes to\nzero, the mutual information I(A : E|ρ A,E ) goes to zero, and the state ρ A goes to the completely mixed state ρ A mix . Hence, we can adopt the quantity I (A : E|ρ A,E ) as a criterion for qualifying the secret random number.\nUsing the trace norm, we can evaluate the secrecy for the state ρ as follows:\nTaking into account the randomness, Renner [8] deﬁned the following criteria for security of a secret random number:\nd 1 (A : E|ρ) 2 ≤ I(A : E|ρ) \t (15) d 1 (A : E|ρ) 2 ≤ I (A : E|ρ). \t (16)\nWhen we apply the function f to the classical random number a ∈ A, H(f (A), E|ρ) ≤ H(A, E|ρ), i.e.,\nWhen we apply a quantum operation E on H E , since it does not act on the classical system A,\nH(A|E|E (ρ)) ≥ H(A|E|ρ) \t (18) H 1+s (A|E|E (ρ)) ≥ H 1+s (A|E|ρ) \t (19)\nTr ρ log σ −1/2 E σ (ρ)σ −1/2 = Tr E σ (ρ) log σ −1/2 E σ (ρ)σ −1/2 , (24)\nWe consider the secure key extraction problem from a common classical random number a ∈ A which has been partially eavesdropped as quantum states by Eve. For this problem, it is assumed that Alice and Bob share a common classical random number a ∈ A, and Eve has a quantum state ρ a ∈ H E , which is correlated to the random number a. The task is to extract a common random number f (a) from the random number a ∈ A, which is almost independent of Eve\u2019s quantum state. Here, Alice and Bob are only allowed to apply the same function f to the common random number a ∈ A. Now, we focus on an ensemble of the functions f X from A to {1, . . . , M }, where X denotes a random variable describing the stochastic behavior of the function f . An ensemble of the functions f X is called universal 2 when it satisﬁes the following condition[4]:\nCondition 1: ∀a 1 = ∀a 2 ∈ A, the probability that f X (a 1 ) = f X (a 2 ) is at most 1 M .\nIndeed, when the cardinality |A| is a power of a prime power q and M is another power of the same prime power q, an ensemble {f X } satisfying the both conditions is given by the the concatenation of Toeplitz matrix and the identity (X, I)[5] only with log q |A| − 1 random variables taking values in the ﬁnite ﬁled F q . That is, the matrix (X, I) has small complexity.\nTheorem 1: When the ensemble of the functions {f X } is universal 2 , it satisﬁes\nThat is, there exists a function f : A → {1, . . . , M } such that\ns \t . \t (28) Next, we consider the case when our state is given by the\nn-fold independent and identical state ρ, i.e., ρ ⊗n .

The second equation holds as follows. the condition lim n→∞ H(f n (A)|ρ ⊗n ) log M\n= 1 is equivalent with lim n→∞ D(ρ fn(A) ρ fn(A) mix ) n \t = 0.

Since lim s→0 H 1+s (A|E|ρ)) = H(A|E|ρ)), there exists a number s ∈ (0, 1] such that s(R − H 1+s (A|E|ρ)) > 0. Thus, the right hand side of (29) goes to zero exponentially.

Converse inequality ≥ follows from (30).\nIn order to show Theorem 1, we prepare the following two lemmas.\nLemma 1: The matrix inequality (I + X) s ≤ I + X s holds with a non-negative matrix X and s ∈ (0, 1].\nProof: Since I is commutative with X, it is sufﬁcient to show that (1 + x) s ≤ 1 + x s for x ≥ 0. This inequality is trivial.\nLemma 2: The matrix inequality log(I + X) ≤ 1 s X s holds with a non-negative matrix X and s ∈ (0, 1].\nProof: Since I is commutative with X, it is sufﬁcient to show that log(1 + x) ≤ x s s for x ≥ 0. Since the inequalities (1 + x) s ≤ 1 + x s and log(1 + x) ≤ x hold for x ≥ 0 and 0 < s ≤ 1, the inequalities\nNow, we prove Theorem 1.

In the commutative case, our lower bound coincides with that given in [13]. which is different from Renner[8]\u2019s two universal hashing lemma. Further, we have derived asymptotic equivocation rate. These results have been obtained by using quantum version of privacy ampliﬁcation theorems by [13], [14].\nThe author is partially supported by a MEXT Grant-in- Aid for Young Scientists (A) No. 20686026 and Grant-in- Aid for Scientiﬁc Research (A) No. 23246071.
