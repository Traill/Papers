Trachtenberg [1] investigated the cross- correlation for the decimation d = p k +2 2 and d = p 2k − p k + 1 when p is an odd prime. Helleseth [2] summarized many known results and evaluated cross-correlation distributions for various values of decimations.

For a more detailed overview on this subject, we refer the reader to [9].\nIn this paper, for an integer k, we derived an upper bound for the cross-correlation of a ternary m-sequence of period 3 4k+2 −1 and its decimation with d = 3 4k+2 −3 2k+1 +2 4 \t +3 2k+1 . It is shown that the upper bound is given as 4.5·3 2k+1 +1. For the derivation, we use the quadratic form theory as in [3]-[8], but in this case four quadratic forms are involved. To obtain possible rank combinations of quadratic forms, Bluher\u2019s result [10], [11] is employed. It is shown that quadratic forms have only even ranks and among four quadratic forms, at most one\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we present preliminaries and notations. In Section III, we investigate the upper bound for the cross-correlation magnitude. Some discussion and a conjecture on the cross- correlation value is proposed in Section IV. Finally, concluding remarks are given in Section V.\nLet p be a prime and n be an integer. Let F p n be the ﬁnite ﬁeld with p n elements. The trace function tr n 1 : F p n → F p is deﬁned as\nA p-ary m sequence s(t) is deﬁned to be s(t) = tr n 1 (α t )\nwhere α is a primitive element of F p n . Let ω be a p-th root of unity in the complex ﬁeld C and a(t), b(t) be sequences over F p of period N . Then the cross-correlation function C(τ ) between a(t) and b(t) at time shift τ is deﬁned as\n  \n−1, if x is a nonzero nonsquare in F p n 0, \t if x = 0.\nA quadratic form over F p with n indeterminates x 1 , x 2 , ... , x n is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 2 in F p n [x 1 , x 2 , ..., x n ], which can be expressed as\nwhere a ij ∈ F p . The matrix A = (a ij ) is called a coefﬁcient matrix of f , and det(f ) = ∆ is deﬁned to be det(A). If the rank of A is k for some 0 ≤ k ≤ n, then we say that the rank of f is also k. If rank(f ) = n, f is said to be nondegenerate. For a nondegenerate quadratic form f over F p , one can calculate the number of solutions of f (x 1 , x 2 , ..., x n ) = b for b ∈ F p by the following lemma.\nLemma 1: [12] Let η be the quadratic character of F p . The number of solutions N (b) of f (x 1 , x 2 , ..., x n ) = b in F n p , when f is a nondegenerate quadratic form in rank n with determinant ∆ and b ∈ F p , is given as follows:\np n−1 − p n−2 2 , \t if b = 0 p n−1 − (p − 1)p n−2 2 , if b = 0\nwhere = η((−1) n/2 ∆).

Then\nn/2 , \t if n is even i3 n/2 , if n is odd\nwhere = η((−1) n/2 ∆) for even n and = η((−1) (n−1)/2 ∆) for odd n.\nFor the case of rank(f ) = k < n, we can obtain the number of solutions by multiplying the result of Lemma 1 or Lemma 2 by p n−k . The rank of the quadratic form can be determined by the following lemma.\nLemma 3: [3] Let f ∈ F p [x 1 , x 2 , ..., x n ] be a quadratic form. Deﬁne\nZ = {z ∈ F n p : f (x + z) − f (x) = 0 for all x ∈ F n p }. Then Z is a subspace of F n p and rank(r) = n − dim(Z).\nLet q be a prime power and m be an integer. A polynomial of the form\nwith coefﬁcients in F q m is called a linearized polynomial over F q m . For an extension ﬁeld F of F q m , we have\nL(x + y) = L(x) + L(y), for all x, y ∈ F L(cx) = cL(x), for all x ∈ F and c ∈ F q .\nThus the set of roots of a linearized polynomial is a vector space over F q and the number of roots is a power of q.\nThe following lemmas will be used to determine the number of solutions of some linearized polynomials.\nLemma 4: [10] [11] Let h c (x) = x p s +1 − cx + c, c ∈ F ∗ p n . Then h c (x) = 0 has either 0, 1, 2, or pgcd (s,n) + 1 roots in\nLemma 5: [10] Let F be a ﬁnite ﬁeld of charateristic p and c ∈ F ∗ . Suppose q is a power of p and F ∩ F q = F Q . Deﬁne f (x) = x q+1 − cx + c. Then the following are equivalent.\n3) f has at least two roots in F and N F /F Q (r − 1) = 1 for all root r in F .\nBy setting F = F p 4k+2 , q = p 2k in Lemma 5, we have the following result.\nCorollary 6: Let k be an integer, n = 4k + 2, and p be an odd prime. Then F p n ∩F p 2k = F p 2 . Let f (x) = x p 2k +1 −cx+c, c ∈ F ∗ p n . Then the following are equivalent.\nLet k be an integer and n = 2m = 2 + 4k, d = 3 n −3 m +2 4 \t + 3 m . Suppose F 3 n is a ﬁnite ﬁeld with 3 n elements. Set α be a primitive elements of F 3 n . Let N = 3 n − 1 be the period of m-sequence in F 3 n . Then gcd(N, d) = 3 m +1 4 . Set 0 ≤ l < N/gcd(N, d) = 4(3 m + 1). We consider the cross-correlation function C(τ ) between tr n 1 (α t ) and tr n 1 (α dt+l ) with time shift τ . Then C(τ ) is given as\nwhere γ = α dτ +l and ω is a third primitive root of unity. Let x = y 3 n−1 −1 . Since d(3 n−1 −1) = 3 n/2 +1 = 3 m +1 mod N , we have\nThus we have quadratic forms in y. Since (3 n−1 −1, 3 n −1) = 4, we must consider a i ∈ C i , 0 ≤ i ≤ 3, so that\nwhere C i = {α 4t+i |0 ≤ t < 3 n −1 4 }. Here g i (y) = tr n 1 (a i y 3 n−1 −1 − γa d i y 3 m +1 ), 0 ≤ i ≤ 3, are quadratic forms. To derive the upper bound of the absolute values of the cross- correlation, it is standard to obtain the rank of the quadratic forms and apply Lemma 1. By Lemma 3, investigating the rank of g i (y) can be done by counting the number of z such that g i (y + z) − g i (y) = 0 for all y ∈ F 3 n . Simplifying the equation g i (y + z) − g i (y) = 0 gives us\ntr n 1 (y(a i 3 z 3 + a i z 3 n−1 − (γa d i ) 3 m z 3 m − γa d i z 3 m ) +a i z 3 n−1 +1 − γa d i z 3 m +1 ) = 0.\na i 3 z 3 + a i z 3 n−1 − (γa d i ) 3 m z 3 m − γa i z 3 m = 0 tr n 1 (a i z 3 n−1 +1 − γa d i z 3 m +1 ) = 0.\nHere we claim that the ﬁrst equation is sufﬁcient condition for the second. Indeed,\n⇔ 2tr n 1 (a i 3 z 3+1 − γa d i z 3 m +1 ) = 0 ⇔ tr n 1 (a i 3 z 3+1 − γa d i z 3 m +1 ) = 0.\nLet f i (z) = a i 3 z 3 + a i z 3 n−1 − (γa d i ) 3 m z 3 m − γa d i z 3 m . By the discussion above, it is sufﬁcient to count the number of roots of linearized polynomial f i (z). Now we prove that the number of roots of the linearized polynomial f i (z) is one of 1, 9, and 81. Note that the linearized polynomial f i (z) has the degree 3 n−1 , which is not constant, but depends on n.\nLemma 7: The number of roots of the linearized polyno- mial f i (z), i = 0, 1, 2 or 3, is one of 1, 9, and 81. Proof: We have the following equalities\nHere we assume z = 0. By dividing the both sides by z 3 m , we obtain\nLet X = z 3 m−1 −1 . Since (3 m−1 − 1, 3 n − 1) = 3 2 − 1 = 8, this transform is an 8-1 map. Deﬁne B i = (γa d i ) 3 m + γa d i and Y = a i X. Then the equality becomes\nSet A i = a i 3 m +1 . Note A ∈ F 3 m . Let Y 3 = x. It is a one-to- one mapping since (3 n − 1, 3) = 1. Thus,\nThen by Lemma 4, the number of solutions of y 3 m−1 +1 − c i y + c i = 0 is one of 0, 1, 2, and 3 (m−1,n) + 1 = 3 2 + 1 = 10. Since the mapping is 8- 1 map, the number of solutions is one among 0, 8, 16, and 80. Adding a zero root (z = 0), we have 1, 9, 17, and 81. Since the original equation is a linearized polynomial, 17 cannot be a number of root. Thus the linearized polynomial can have only 1, 9, and 81 roots.\nNext we show that among the four linearized polynomials f i (z), 0 ≤ i ≤ 3, at most one polynomial can have 81 roots.\nLemma 8: Among the four linearized polynomials f i (z), 0 ≤ i ≤ 3, at most one polynomial can have 81 solutions. Or equivalently, among four polynomials h i (y) = y 3 m−1 +1 − c i y + c i , 0 ≤ i ≤ 3, at most one polynomial can have 10 solutions.\nProof: Without loss of generality, we may assume that a i = α i . By the previous lemma, we have the following relation\nSuppose β = α 3n −1 3m −1 = α 3 m +1 is a primitive element of the subﬁeld F 3 m . Since a 3 m +1 i \t = (α i ) 3 m +1 = β i , for i = 0, 2, a 3 m +1 i \t is a square in the subﬁeld, and for i = 1, 3, a 3 m +1 i \t is a nonsquare element of the subﬁeld. The numerator (tr n m (γa d i )) 3 m−1 +1 is always a square in the subﬁeld F 3 m . Consequently, c i is a square in the subﬁeld if i = 0, 2, and a nonsquare if i = 1, 3. We claim that only f 0 (z) can have 81 roots. Suppose f i (z) has 81 roots. First assume that i = 0 or i = 2. By Corollary 6, we have\nSince c i is a square in F 3 m , c i = β 2k for some k. Also note that β = α 4l for some l. Therefore we have\nThus (y 3 m−1 +1 ) 3n −1 32 −1 = 1. Since 3 m−1 + 1 = 2 mod 4, we can substitute as y 3 m−1 +1 = x 4k+2 . Then we have\nTherefore y 3m−1 +1 2 \t = x 2k+1 = α 4l for some l . But since ( 3 m−1 +1 2 , 4) = 1, we have y = α 4l . From (2), ya 3 i = tr n m (γa d i )z 3 m −3 . Here all terms in the right hand side are in C 0 . We already observed that y ∈ C 0 . Therefore we must have a i ∈ C 0 . This implies that i = 0. Now assume that i = 1 or i = 3. This means that c i is a nonsquare in F 3 n . Thus, we can write c i = β 2k+1 = (α 4l ) 2k+1 = α 8lk+4l . Note that l is odd since m is odd. Applying Corollary 6 again, we have (3), but for this case, it follows that\nTherfore (y 3 m−1 +1 ) 3n −1 32 −1 = −1. Since 3 m−1 + 1 = 2 mod 4, we can substitute as 3 m−1 + 1 = 4k + 2 for some k. Then we have\nwhere k is some odd integer. Thus y must be a square in F 3 n . Let y = α 2l for some integer l . From (4), it follows that\nTherefore, l is odd. Thus y ∈ C 2 . From (2), we have a i ∈ C 2 . This implies that c i is in C 2 , which contradicts i = 1 or i = 3. Therefore if f i (z) has 81 roots, then i = 0.\nIt is well known that the number of roots of the linearized polynomial f i (z) is equal to 3 n−rank(g i (y)) . Therefore by what we have dicussed so far, each g i (y) has a rank of n, n − 2, or n − 4, and only one of g i (y) can have the rank n − 4 for i = 0, 1, 2, 3. Thus we can enumrate 9 possible rank combinations of g i (y), i = 0, 1, 2, 3, ignoring order as\n(n, n, n − 2, n − 2), (n, n, n − 2, n − 4), \t (5) (n, n − 2, n − 2, n − 2), (n, n − 2, n − 2, n − 4),\nFor each of these rank combinations, we can derive the upper bound of the cross-correlation values using Lemma 2. We will check only for the last case, (n − 2, n − 2, n − 2, n − 4). Using Lemma 2, it follows that\n= 3( 0 + 1 + 2 )3 m + 3 2 3 3 m ≤ 18 · 3 m\nwhere 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , are determined to be 1 or −1 according to the rank and determinant of the quadratic forms. Thus in this case, the magnitude of the cross-correlation function C(τ ) is upper bounded by 4.5 · 3 m + 1. It is easily checked that among all the rank combinations above, (n − 2, n − 2, n − 2, n − 4) yields the largest upper bound for C(τ ). Therefore, we have the following theorem.\nTheorem 9: For an integer k ≥ 0, n = 4k + 2 = 2m, d = 3 n −3 m +2 4 \t + 3 m , and 0 ≤ l < 4(3 m + 1), the magnitude of the cross-correlation function C(τ ) between tr n 1 (α t ) and tr n 1 (α dt+l ) is upper bounded by\nFirst we consider an example. Suppose n = 4k +2 = 2m = 6 and d = 203. For all l going through 0 to 4(3 m + 1) − 1 = 103, by computer search, the cross-correlation distribution between tr n 1 (α t ) and tr n 1 (α dt+l ) is given as\n           \n          \n−1, 34328 times −28, 18095 times 26, \t 14973 times −82, 833 times\nNote that the cross-correlation is 7-valued. The similar result is obtained for n = 10. Based on these, we propose the following conjecture on the cross-correlation distribution.\nConjecture 10: For an integer k ≥ 0, n = 4k + 2 = 2m, d = 3 n −3 m +2 4 \t + 3 m , and 0 ≤ l < 4(3 m + 1), the cross- correlation function C(τ ) between tr n 1 (α t ) and tr n 1 (α dt+l ) takes values in {−1, −1 ± 3 m , −1 ± 3 m+1 , −1 ± (3 − 1)3 m }.\nTherefore the magnitude of C(τ ) is upper bounded by 3·3 m + 1.\nThe main difﬁculty of the problem originates from two factors. First, since there are more than two quadratic forms involved, we have to exclude more candidate values for the cross-correlation. In computer search, we found that every rank combination in (5) actually appear. Thus we have to rule out some combinations of i values, so that some exponential sums in (6) cancel out each other. One typical technique to do this is to set g i (y) = rg j (y) for some nonsquare r so that det(g i ) = r k det(g j ), where k is a rank of g i and g j . If k is odd, we can conclude that i = − j as we wish to show. But in our case, all ranks of quadratic forms are even. This is the second factor which makes the problem difﬁcult.\nIn this paper, we investigate the upper bound for the crosscorrelation function between a ternary m-sequence of period n = 4k + 2 and its decimated sequence with the decimation d = 3 4k+2 −3 2k+1 +2 4 \t + 3 2k+1 . It is shown that the cross-correlation is upper bounded by 4.5 · 3 n/2 + 1. For the derivation, it is proved that 1, 9, 81 are only possible number of solutions of linearized polynomials and only one among four linearized polynomials can have 81 roots. A conjecture on the exact cross-correlation value is proposed as an open problem.\nThis work was supported by the National Research Foun- dation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MEST) (No. 2011-0000328) and the KCC (Korea Com- munications Commission), Korea, under the R&D program supervised by the KCA (Korea Communications Agency) (KCA-2011-08913-04003)"},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"H.
