As shown by Neyman and Pearson, the binary hypothesis testing (in the case of simple hypotheses) admits an optimal solution based on thresholding the relative density of P with respect to Q (a Radon-Nikodym derivative). The asymptotic behavior of the tradeoff between the two types of errors has also been well studied by Stein, Chernoff, Hoeffding and Blahut. Knowledge of this tradeoff is important by itself and is also useful for other parts of information theory, such as channel coding [1, Section III.E] and data compression [2, Section IV.A].\nThe problem becomes, however, much more complex with the introduction of structural constraints on the allowable tests. For example, it may happen that observations consist of two parts, say X n = (X 1 , . . . , X n ) and Y n = (Y 1 , . . . , Y n ), which need to be compressed down to nR bits each before the decision is taken. Even the memoryless case, in which under either hypothesis the pairs (X i , Y i ) are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) according to P XY or Q XY , is a notoriously hard problem with only a handful of special cases solved [3]\u2013[6]. Formally, this problem corresponds to ﬁnding the best test of the form\nT = 1{(f (X n ), g(Y n )) ∈ A} , \t (1) where optimization is over functions f and g with ﬁnite co- domains of cardinality 2 nR and critical regions A. Here and below T = 1 designates the test choosing the distribution P and T = 0 the distribution Q.\nAnother rich source of difﬁcult problems is the distributed case, in which observations are taken by spatially separated sensors (whose measurements are typically assumed to be\ncorrelated in space but not in time). The goal is then to optimize the communication cost by designing (single letter) quantizers and a good (single or multi round) protocol for exchanges between the sensors and the fusion center; see [7]\u2013 [9] and references therein. These problems can again be restated in the form of constraining the allowable tests similar to (1).\nIn this paper we consider tests employing a comparator, namely those satisfying the constraint:\nT = 1{f (X n ) = g(Y n )} , \t (2) where the cardinality of the common co-domain of f and g is unrestricted. This constraint is motivated by the meta-converse method [1, Section III.E], which proves a lower bound on probability of error by ﬁrst using a channel code as a binary hypothesis test and then comparing its performance with that of an optimal (Neyman-Pearson) test. However, so constructed test necessarily satisﬁes the structural constraint (2) and thus it is natural to investigate whether imposing (2) incurs expo- nential performance loss.\nAnother situation in which tests of the form (2) occur naturally is in the analysis of parallel systems, such as in fault- tolerant parallel computers, that under normal circumstances perform a redundant computation of a complicated function with high probability of agreement, while it is required to lower bound the probability of agreement when the fault occurs (modeled as P XY changing to Q XY ). Yet another case is in testing hypotheses of biological nature based on the observation of zygosity of cells only (in eukaryotes).\nThe main result is that in the memoryless setting Stein exponent of tests satisfying (2) can indeed be quite a bit smaller than D (P XY ||Q XY ) and in fact is given by\nwhere D (·||·) is the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and the optimization is over all joint distributions V XY with marginals matching those of P XY . In particular, E = 0 if (and only if) the marginals of Q XY coincide with those of P XY .\nIn fact, for the latter case, the hypothesis testing with constraint (2) turns out to be intimately related to a problem of determining the common information C (X; Y ) in the sense of G´acs and K¨orner [10]. Using a technique pioneered by Witsenhausen [11] we show that the error probability cannot decay to zero at all (even subexponentially). Unfortunately, this is only shown under the condition that the conﬁdence level is sufﬁciently high. Extending to the general case appears to be surprisingly hard. For a special case of binary X and Y\nwe describe a bound based on Delsarte\u2019s linear programming method [12] and demonstrate promising numerical results. However, we have not yet been able to identify a convenient\npolynomial, such as found in [13] for the coding in Hamming space, admitting an asymptotic analysis.\nThe exponent E has appeared before in the context of hypothesis testing with rate constraints (1), see [4, Theorems 5 and 8], and distributed detection [8, Theorem 2]. We identify the reasons for this below and also use this correspondence to prove the strong converse for the results in [4].\nConsider a distribution P XY on X ×Y. We denote a product distribution on X n × Y n by P n XY and by P XY > 0 the fact that P XY is non-zero everywhere on X × Y.\nFix some P XY and Q XY . For each integer n ≥ 1 and 0 ≤ α ≤ 1 the performance of the best possible comparator hypothesis test of conﬁdence level α is given by\nwhere inﬁmum is over all (perhaps, randomized) maps f : X n → R and g : Y n → R such that\nwhere T is deﬁned in (2). Here and below we follow the agreement that P and Q denote measures on some abstract spaces carrying random variables (X n , Y n ) distributed as P n XY and Q n XY , resp..\nFor a ﬁnite X × Y and a given distribution P XY we deﬁne a bipartite graph with an edge joining x ∈ X to y ∈ Y if P XY (x, y) > 0. The connected components of this graph are called components of P XY and the entropy of the random variable indexing the components is called the common information of X and Y , cf. [10]. If the graph is connected, then P XY is called indecomposable. In particular indecomposability implies P X > 0 and P Y > 0.\nWe also deﬁne a maximal correlation coefﬁcient S (X; Y ) between two random variables X and Y as\nsupremum taken over all zero-mean functions of unit vari- ance. For ﬁnite X × Y indecomposability of P XY implies S (X; Y ) < 1 and (under assumption P X > 0,P Y > 0) is equivalent to it.\nFinally, we recall [10] that a pair of sets A ∈ X n and B ∈ Y n is called a λ-block for P n XY if P n X [A] > 0, P n Y [B] > 0 and\nTheorem 1 ([10]): Let P XY be an indecomposable distri- bution on a ﬁnite X × Y. Then for every λ n ≥ exp{−o(n)} there exists a sequence ν n = o(n) such that for all n any λ n -block (A, B) for P n XY satisﬁes\nTheorem 2: Consider an indecomposable P XY on a ﬁnite X × Y. Then for an arbitrary Q XY and any 0 < α < 1 we\nwhere E is deﬁned in (3). Moreover, if E = ∞ then there exists n 0 (α) such that ˜ β α (P n XY , Q n XY ) = 0 for all n ≥ n 0 .\nf (x n ) = 1{x n ∈ T n [P X ] } , \t (4) g (y n ) = 2 · 1{y n ∈ T n [P Y ] } , \t (5)\nwhere T n [P ] denotes the set of P -typical sequences [14, Chapter 2] over the alphabet of P . Then, on one hand by typicality:\n≥ 1 − o(1) . \t (7) On the other hand, using joint-type decomposition it is straightforward to show that the set T n [P X ] × T n [P Y ] under the product measure Q n XY satisﬁes\nFor the case of E < ∞, this has been demonstrated in the proof of [4, Theorem 5]. For the case E = ∞, we need to show that for all n ≥ n 0 we have\nIndeed, assuming otherwise we ﬁnd a sequence of typical pairs (x n , y n ) with positive Q XY -probability. But then the sequence of the joint types V (n) XY associated to (x n , y n ) belongs to the closed set of joint distributions {V XY : V XY ≪ Q XY } and by compactness must have a limit point ¯ V XY . By the δ-convention [14, Chapter 2], the accumulation point must have marginals ¯ V X = P X and ¯ V Y = P Y and thus E ≤ D ( ¯ V XY ||Q XY ) < ∞ \u2013 a contradiction.\nConverse: We reduce to the special case of the theorem, stated as Theorem 3 below. If E = ∞ then there is nothing to prove, so assume otherwise and take an arbitrary V XY with V X = P X , V Y = P Y and D (V XY ||Q XY ) < ∞. Our goal is\nIf V XY > 0 then we can replace V XY with (1 − ǫ)V XY + ǫP X P Y , which is everywhere positive on X × Y, and then take a limit as ǫ → 0 in (9). Thus we assume V XY > 0.\nA n △ = {f (X n ) = g(Y n )} . By the special case of the theorem we have\nV n XY [A n ] ≥ exp{−o(n)} . \t (10) Then, by a standard change of measure argument, we must have\nOptimizing the choice of V XY in (11) proves (9) and the Theorem.\nTheorem 3 (Special case E = 0): Let P XY be indecom- posable, Q XY > 0 and Q X = P X , Q Y = P Y . Then for any 0 < α < 1 we have\nProof: First we show that any test of level α must contain a λ-block with λ ≥ α 2 . Indeed, each pair ({f (X n ) = i }, {g(Y n ) = i}) is a λ i -block for some λ i (chosen to be maximum possible). Then, by the Bayes rule and max{x, y} ≤ x + y we get\nP [f (X n ) = g(Y n ) = i] ≤ λ i (P[f (X n ) = i]+P[g(Y n ) = i]) . Summing this over i shows that at least one λ i ≥ α 2 .\nBy the G´acs-K¨orner effect (Theorem 1) the probability of this λ-block is subexponentially large:\nQ [f (X n ) = i] ≥ exp{−o(n)} , \t (13) Q [g(Y n ) = i] ≥ exp{−o(n)} . \t (14)\nThus, the sets {f (X n ) = i} and {g(Y n ) = i} must occupy a subexponential fraction of typical sets T n [P X ] and T n [P Y ] . In view of (8) it is natural to expect that\nQ [f (X n ) = g(Y n ) = i] ≥ exp{−o(n)} \t (15) (note that marginals match and thus E = 0 as per (3)). Under the assumption Q XY > 0 it is indeed straightforward to show (15) by an application of blowing-up lemma; see [6, Theorem 3].\nIt should be emphasized that although intuitively one imag- ines that the behavior of ˜ β α should markedly depend on how the connected components of P XY and Q XY relate to each other, Theorem 2 demonstrates that the Stein exponent is not sensitive to the decomposition of Q XY .\nThe assumption of indecomposability of P XY in Theo- rem 2, however, is essential. Indeed, consider the case of X = Y = {0, 1} and X = Y uniform (under P XY ) vs X, Y\nindependent uniform (under Q XY ). Clearly a test {X n = Y n } demonstrates\nWe also remark that the case of E = ∞ is possible. For example, let X, Y be binary with P XY (0, y) = 1 2 − P XY (1, y) = p 2 for p > 1 2 , and Q XY (x, y) = 1 2 1{x = y}.\nThe exponent E in (3) is related to hypothesis testing under the communication constraint (1). In fact, Theorem 2 extends [4, Theorem 5] to the entire range 0 < ǫ < 1, thereby establishing the full strong converse. This result has been obtained in [6] under different assumptions on P XY and\nCorollary 4: Consider a hypothesis testing between an in- decomposable P XY and an arbitrary Q XY with structural restriction on tests of the form\nwith binary-valued f . Then for any 0 < ǫ < 1 we have inf Q[T = 1] = exp{−nE + o(n)} ,\nwhere inﬁmum is over all tests satisfying P [T = 1] ≥ 1 − ǫ and E is given by (3).\nProof: Clearly, any test with binary-valued f and g of the form (2) is also a test of the form (17). Thus Theorem 2 establishes the achievability part. Conversely, for any test of the form (17) we may ﬁnd sets A 0 and A 1 such that\n∪{Y n ∈ A 1 , f (X n ) = 1}] (18) ≥ 1 − ǫ . \t (19)\nThen without loss of generality assume that the ﬁrst set in the union has P-probability larger than 1−ǫ 2 . Deﬁne the following function\nand thus by Theorem 2 we conclude that Q [T = 1] is at least exp{−nE + o(n)}.\nWe remark that the correspondence between the hypothesis tests with 1-bit compression and those of interest in this paper (2) does not hold in full generality. In particular, it was shown in [4, Theorem 5] that the exponent E in (3) is still optimal in the 1-bit scenario without the requirement of indecomposability of P XY , while example (16) demonstrates the contrary for our setup.\nBy Theorem 3 in the case when marginals of P XY and Q XY coincide the error cannot decay to zero exponentially. In fact, we conjecture that in the cases of matching marginals ˜ β α (P n XY , Q n XY ) does not vanish at all. In this section we prove the conjecture under additional assumptions and discuss potential methods for extending to the general case.\nTheorem 5: Consider a P XY and Q XY = P X P Y such that S △ = S(X; Y ) < 1 2 (under P XY ). Then for any α ∈ (2S, 1] we have\nProof: As in the proof of Theorem 3 given a test {f (X n ) = g(Y n )} of level α we can extract a λ-block (A, B) with λ > α 2 . We want to show that for some constant p = p(α) > 0 and all n at least one of the marginals P n X [A] or P n Y [B] can be bounded away from zero:\nmax{P n X [A], P n Y [B]} ≥ p . \t (21) Indeed, then we have\nwhich follows because in a λ-block the smaller of the two probabilities in (21) should still be larger than the joint prob- ability P n XY [A × B] which is ≥ λp. Finally, the estimate (21) follows from the next result.\nProof: Consider an operator T n : L 2 (Y n , P n Y ) → L 2 (X n , P n X ) deﬁned as follows: 2\n(T n h )(x n ) △ = E [f (Y n )|X n = x n ] , \t (24) where the expectation is over the distribution P n XY . Note that the second largest singular value of T n is precisely the maximal correlation coefﬁcient S (X; Y ) (under P XY ), see [15]. Thus, for any zero-mean functions h ∈ L 2 (X n ) and h \u2032 ∈ L 2 (Y n ) we have\nE [h(X n )h \u2032 (Y n )] = (T n h \u2032 , h ) ≤ S(X; Y )||h|| 2 ||h \u2032 || 2 . (25) Denote p A = P n X [A], p B = P n Y [B] and assume p B ≥ p A . If p B ≥ 1 2 then there is nothing to prove, so assume otherwise. Then, we have\nλp B ≤ P n XY [A × B] \t (26) ≤ p A p B + S p A (1 − p A )p B (1 − p B ) (27) ≤ p 2 B + Sp B (1 − p B ) , \t (28)\nwhere (26) is by the deﬁnition of a λ-block, (27) is by (25) applied to h (x n ) = 1{x n ∈ A} − p A and h \u2032 = 1{y n ∈ B } − p B ; and (28) is because p A ≤ p B ≤ 1 2 . Canceling p B on both sides in (28) we obtain (23).\nNext, we discuss what is required to extend Theorem 5 to full generality. To handle a general Q XY one needs a non- vanishing lower bound independent of n on\nwhere the minimization is over Q n X [A], Q n Y [B] ≥ p. For Q XY = P X P Y this problem is void since λ min (p, P n X P n Y ) =\np 2 . Nevertheless, even the case of Q XY = P X P Y is far from being resolved as we need to extend to the full range 0 < α < 1. We discuss this second problem further.\nIn a nutshell, the proof of Theorem 5 consisted of two steps. First, we identiﬁed a Markov chain\nwhere we denoted F △ = f (X n ), G △ = g(Y n ). Note that by the data-processing for maximal correlation we have\nSecond, for large α we showed a lower bound Q [F = G] =\nunder conditions: a) P [F = G] ≥ α and b) S(F ; G) ≤ S. Can a lower bound be tightened so that it does not vanish for all α > 0?\nThe answer is negative. Indeed, consider a distribution P F G on [M ] × [M ]:\nThen we have S (F ; G) = α − 1−α M −1 . That is, such P F G sat- isﬁes the α-constraint and the maximal correlation constraint whenever α ≤ S(X; Y ) and achieves\nIt may appear that as a workaround one may consider higher spectral invariants in addition to S (X; Y ). Formally, to any joint distribution P n XY we associate the operator T n as in (24). Let the singular values of T n sorted in decreasing order be\nClearly this extends the data-processing for maximal correla- tion used in the proof of Theorem 5. Does it lead to a lower- bound non-vanishing for all α?\nAlas, the answer is negative. Indeed, in the example (30) the singular spectrum associated to P F G consists of 1 and 1−α M −1 (of multiplicity M − 1). This spectrum satisﬁes (31) as long as α ≤ S(X; Y ) and M ≤ n + 1. Thus, for α ≤ S(X; Y ), inequalities (31) can not rule out the possibility that\nAnother method to extend the range of α in Theorem 5 is to ﬁnd a non-vanishing (as n → ∞) lower bound on the marginal probability P X n [A] of a λ-block (A, B). In fact, it is enough to consider the case of P XY with X = Y and P X = P Y . Indeed, consider an arbitrary λ-block (A, B) and construct a Markov kernel W : X → X as composition W = P X |Y ◦ P Y |X , namely\nThen distribution P X is a stationary distribution of the Markov chain associated with W (and operator of conditional expec- tation (24) is self-adjoint). Moreover, we clearly have\nAnd hence, it is enough to lower bound P n X [A] among all A with the requirement that (A, A) be a λ 2 -block for W : X → X . In other words:\nProblem ( λ-blocks of minimal weight): Given a Markov kernel W : X → X with stationary distribution P X determine\nIn fact, for the purpose of extending Theorem 5 we only need to show λ ∗ (0+) = 0.\nIn the remaining we consider a special case of X = Y = {0, 1} and W (0|1) = W (1|0) = δ \u2013 a binary symmetric channel, BSC (δ). First, let us consider sets A ⊂ {0, 1} n which are linear subspaces, then denoting by Z n a vector with i.i.d.
