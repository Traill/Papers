Several measures are sought to address this problem: Freeing up unused spectrum, sharing of spectrum through new paradigms such as cognitive radio sensing, as well as sophisticated communication schemes that rely on user cooperation. Such schemes involve not only cooperative sharing of spectrum but also relaying. However, given that cooperation can lead to rate degradation, this may fail to happen with selﬁsh users. This leads us to ask: Why would users cooperate in relaying? . What happens if they don\u2019t? [1]. We investigate these questions for a prototypical communication channel model that depends on such cooperation for relaying.\nThe (standard) relay channel model was introduced by van der Meulen [2]. This involved communication from a transmitter (node 1) to a receiver (node 3) with the aid of a passive relay (node 2), i.e., the relay node does not have any information of its own to send. An upper bound\non the capacity of this channel was obtained by Cover and El Gamal [3]. Carleial introduced a more general version of the simple relay channel usually called the multi-access channel with generalized feedback (MAC- GF) [4]. In this model, node 1 and node 2 cooperate in transmitting independent messages to node 3. However the communication constraints between node 1 and node 2 were not taken into consideration which made this model less attractive due to practical consideration. A more general encoding/decoding strategy for the MAC- GF channel was developed by Willems, et al [5]. They introduced backward decoding and used superposition block Markov decoding to derive an achievable rate re- gion for the MAC-GF channel model. In [6], Sendonaris, et al . looked at the channel model from a different perspective as a method of providing diversity to the sys- tem and they considered the communication constraints between node 1 and node 2. Assuming the channels are Gaussian, they derived an achievable region for this model using the methods developed in [5]. We will refer to this model as the generalized Gaussian relay (GGR) channel model.\nRecently, Ciofﬁ, Tse and their co-workers have re- investigated the achievable rate region of the Gaussian interference channel with selﬁsh users [7], [8]. Here, only transmission powers were regarded as the strategies of the players. A more information-theoretic formulation of the game on the interference channel was given in [9] where they also deﬁned the Nash equilibrium region in the achievable rate region. They gave a complete characterization of such a region for the deterministic interference channel model and and approximate char- acterization (within 1 bit) for the cases of two-user Gaussian interference channel model.\nIn this paper, we investigate the achievable rate re- gion of the generalized Gaussian relay (GGR) channel with selﬁsh users when the Willems, et al. cooperative communication scheme is used by users (as speciﬁed in [6]). Users\u2019 strategies include transmission powers and\nencoding rates, as well as a decision to not cooperate. We characterize all the Nash equilibrium rates and com- pare it with the Pareto-optimal rates of the generalized Gaussian relay channel model. In particular we show that there exists Nash equilibrium points which are not on the Pareto-optimal boundary of the achievable region of the GGR channel.\nThe generalized Gaussian relay channel model is shown in Figure 1. There are two users, both want to transmit data to a common destination. There are two differences from the standard relay channel model [3]. User i has its own information to send, denoted by W i . Both users can cooperate by relaying each others\u2019 data in some fashion. This would increase both their transmission rates. (In the standard relay channel, user 2 may help user 1 to increase its data rate but not the other way round). When users are not cooperating in their transmission, this model reduces to the standard two-user MAC channel for which the capacity region is well known.\nWillems, et al . gave the best-known encoding strate- gies that the transmitting users can use, and a decoding strategy to be used by the receiver. Sendonaris, et al employed this communication scheme in his cooperative communication model. We refer the reader to [6] and the references therein for more details. In this paper, we assume that either the two transmitting users do not cooperate at all, and if they do, the two transmitters and the receiver use the Willems, et al. encoding/decoding scheme. However, since users are assumed selﬁsh, even while \u201ccooperating\u201d they can deviate from the \u201coptimal\u201d Sendonaris scheme by using a different power, transmis- sion rates, or can refuse to cooperate entirely.\nThe discrete time mathematical model of the channel (shown in Figure 1) is given by\nY 1 = K 12 X 1 + Z 1 \t (1) Y 2 = K 21 X 2 + Z 2 .\nThe Y 0 , Y 1 , Y 2 are the received signals at the destina- tion 0, user 1 and user 2 respectively. X i is the signal transmitted by user i, and Z i is additive channel noise which is i.i.d. with distribution N (0, 1). We assume that the transmission is done for B blocks of length n each, and both B and n are large. Both users employ a \u201ccooperative\u201d strategy based on the superposition block Markov encoding and backward decoding [5]. More speciﬁcally, user 1 divides information W 1 into two\nparts: W 10 to be sent directly to the destination, and W 12 to be sent to the destination via user 2. In addition to these, it also sends an additional \u201ccooperative\u201d infor- mation to the destination for enhanced decoding. In any block, user 1\u2019s transmitted signal X 1 is structured as\nX 12 = P 12 ˜ X 12 (W 12 (i), W 12 (i − 1), W 21 (i − 1)) (2) U 1 = P U 1 ˜ U (W 12 (i − 1), W 21 (i − 1))\nand the total power P 1 is divided into (P 10 , P 12 , P U 1 ) such that P 1 = P 10 + P 12 + P U 1 . The user selects\n˜ X 10 , ˜ X 12 , ˜ U from i.i.d. samples from the N (0, 1) dis- tribution.\nHere, U 1 denotes that part of the signal that carries the \u201ccooperative\u201d information. Power used for transmitting X 10 directly to the destination is denoted by P 10 , which encodes W 10 at rate R 10 . Power used for transmitting X 12 to user 2 is denoted P 12 , which encodes W 12 to user 2 at the rate R 12 , and power used to transmit U 1 to the destination is denoted P U 1 , which encodes the \u201ccooperative\u201d information. User 2 constructs its transmit signal X 2 similarly.\nNow, user 2 can construct its signal X 2 only if it can perfectly decode W 12 . Thus, tranmission rate R 12 (and power P 12 ) should be selected by user 1 so that W 12 can be decoded perfectly by user 2. Similarly, rate R 21 (and power P 21 ) should be selected by user 2 so that W 21 can be decoded perfectly by user 1.\nIt was shown in [6] that an achievable rate region with this scheme for the generalized Gaussian relay channel is given as the convex hull of all rate pairs (R 1 , R 2 ) such\nwhere C(x) := 1 2 log(1 + x), for some power allocation satisfying P 10 + P 12 + P U 1 = P 1 and P 20 + P 21 + P U 2 = P 2 .\nThe proof can be found in [6] and the references therein. The essential ideas are backward decoding and coherent combining of the cooperative signals U 1 and U 2 . By virtue of the backward decoding, the destination will decode W 12 (i) and W 21 (i) from block i + 1. Thus, decoding the ith block involves decoding the messages W 10 (i), W 20 (i), W 12 (i−1) and W 21 (i−1). The receiver decodes W 12 and W 21 jointly which are encoded in the \u201ccooperative\u201d parts of the transmitted signals, U 1 and U 2 . So, effectively the receiver has to decode three different streams of data, the joint stream (W 12 , W 21 ), W 10 and W 20 from the aggregate signal. This is done in the same way as successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding in a 3-user MAC channel. As in the MAC channel, the receiver can decode these streams in any order. For example, the receiver can do joint decoding of (W 12 , W 21 ) ﬁrst, W 10 second and W 20 last. The achievable rate region is computed by considering all such possible decoding orders.\nBoth users are rational and selﬁsh, with their utility functions equal to the total rates R 1 and R 2 that they achieve. Hence, they will optimize their power allocation to maximize their individual rate.\nA strategy of user i is his encoding rates (R i0 , R ij ) and power allocation (P i0 , P ij , P U i ) such that P i0 + P ij + P U i ≤ P i , j = i. Denote the strategy vector s i = (R i0 , R ij , P i0 , P ij , P U i ). Each user receives a payoff equal to his achieved rate. Thus, U i (s 1 , s 2 ) = R i = R i0 + R ij if the power allocation for the two users satisﬁes their power budgets and their encoding rates satisfy the inequalities (3), else it is 0. Now, we deﬁne Nash equilibrium region for the generalized relay channel.\nThe Nash equilibrium rate region is the set of all achiev- able encoding rates (R 1 , R 2 ) that are achieved at a Nash equilibrium.\nAs usual, it says that no player can increase his rate by a unilateral deviation.\nAs already mentioned, the receiver can do decoding in various orders. To determine if a particular rate pair (R 1 , R 2 ) is a NE, we need to know the actual decoding scheme/order being used by the receiver (among those that can be used to achieve that rate pair). The role of the receiver in the game is to a priori choose a decoding order, possibly after it knows the channel conditions (K 10 , K 20 , K 12 , K 21 ). There are six possible decoding orders.\n(i) Decoding order D 1 : Receiver decodes (W 12 , W 21 ) ﬁrst, W 10 next, and W 20 last.\n(ii) Decoding order D 2 : Receiver decodes (W 12 , W 21 ) ﬁrst, W 20 next, and W 10 last.\n(iii) Decoding order D 3 : Receiver decodes W 10 ﬁrst, (W 12 , W 21 ) next, and W 20 last.\n(iv) Decoding order D 4 : Receiver decodes W 20 ﬁrst, (W 12 , W 21 ) next, and W 10 last.\n(v) Decoding order D 5 : Receiver decodes W 20 ﬁrst, W 10 next, and (W 12 , W 21 ) last.\n(vi) Decoding order D 6 : Receiver decodes W 10 ﬁrst, W 20 next, and (W 12 , W 21 ) last.\nThe achievable rate region corresponding to decoding order D i will be denoted by C(D i ). Also denote the Pareto-optimal boundary points of C(D i ) as B(C(D i )). The achievable region C of the GGR channel is the convex hull of C(D i ), i = 1, . . . , 6. Thus any point in C is obtained by time sharing among the various decoding orders C(D i ), i = 1, . . . , 6. This time sharing procedure is explained below.\nWe assume that (without the loss of generality) the length of the transmission (i.e., the length of the game) is T = 1 unit. Before the beginning of the game, the receiver announces a time sharing parameter vector α := (α 1 , . . . , α 6 ) such that 6 i=1 α i = 1. A given α implies that the receiver will perform decoding according to the decoding order D i during the time ( i−1 j=1 α j , i j=1 α j ] for 1 ≤ i ≤ 6 where α 0 = 0. Let (R 1,D i , R 2,D i ) be the rate pair during time ( i−1 j=1 α j , i j=1 α j ] with decoding order D i . Then, the net rate (R 1 , R 2 ) during the time T is calculated as (R 1 , R 2 ) = 6 i=1 α i (R 1,D i , R 2,D i ).\nWe will proceed by proving a series of results. The main question is what rate pairs (R 1 , R 2 ) correspond to a NE. The following proposition gives a restriction on the rate pairs (R 1 , R 2 ) that can be achieved at a Nash equilibrium [9].\nProposition 1. If the rate pair (R 1 , R 2 ) is a Nash equilibrium point, then R i ≥ R i,min := C K 2 10 P i 1+K 2\nProof: Regardless of user j\u2019s encoding scheme, user i can always achieve a minimum rate R i,min =\n, by treating the signal from user j as noise. Thus, if user i gets a rate R i strictly less than R i,min by the cooperative scheme, he has an incentive to deviate from that cooperative scheme and get a higher rate. Thus, if (R 1 , R 2 ) is a NE, then R i ≥ C K 2 i0 P i 1+K 2\nWe denote the \u201ccone\u201d of potential equilibrium rate pairs by Γ := {(R 1 , R 2 ) : R 1 ≥ R 1,min , R 2 ≥ R 2,min }.\nProposition 2. Suppose the decoding order is D i , 1 ≤ i ≤ 6. Any rate pair (R 1 , R 2 ) ∈ Γ ∩ B(C(D i )) is a Nash equilibrium point.\nProof: First consider the decoding order D 1 . Under the decoding order D 1 , the achievable region is given by the following inequalities.\n1 + K 2 21 P 20 \t (5) R 12 + R 21 ≤ ˆ R 12 + ˆ R 21 \t (6)\n1 + K 2 20 P 20 \t (7) R 20 ≤ C K 2 20 P 20 \t (8)\nConsider an (R 1 , R 2 ) ∈ Γ ∩ B(C(D 1 )). At the bound- ary point R 12 + R 21 = ˆ R 12 + ˆ R 21 . To prove this, ﬁrst assume that R 12 + R 21 < ˆ R 12 + ˆ R 21 . Then user 1 can decrease P U 1 and increase P 12 in such a way that R 12 increases but still R 12 + R 21 < ˆ R 12 + ˆ R 21 . This is possible because the change in P 12 and P U 1 will not affect the rate R 21 . Thus, R 21 will remain the same and R 12 will increase. Thus R 12 + R 21 will increase. Note that R 10 and R 20 will be unaffected by the change in P 12 and P U 1 . Thus user 2\u2019s rate (R 2 = R 20 + R 21 ) will remain the same and user 1\u2019s rate (R 1 = R 10 +R 12 ) will\nincrease. This contradicts the assumption that (R 1 , R 2 ) is a boundary point.\nNote that the receiver decodes (W 12 , W 21 ) ﬁrst, W 10 next, and W 20 last. First consider the possible deviations by user 2. He can increase his rate R 20 by increasing P 20 (by taking power from (P 21 , P U 2 )). However, any increase in P 20 will increase the interference for the decoding of W 10 and the decoding will fail. Then SIC will fail and the decoding of R 20 itself will fail. Thus user 2 will not attempt this deviation. The other deviation possible for him is to increase R 21 by increasing the power in (P 21 , P U 2 ) (by taking power from P 20 ). This can potentially increase R 21 while the user 1\u2019s rate remains the same. But, this contradicts the fact that (R 1 , R 2 ) is a boundary point. So, when (R 1 , R 2 ) is a boundary point, user 2 has no incentive to deviate.\nIn the same way we can argue that user 1 also doesn\u2019t have any incentive to deviate.\nWe can prove the same result for all other decoding orders D 2 , . . . , D 6 by similar arguments. These proofs are thus omitted.\nProposition 3. Suppose the decoding order is D i , 1 ≤ i ≤ 6. If a rate pair (R 1 , R 2 ) ∈ Γ ∩ B(C(D i )), then (R 1 , R 2 ) is not a Nash equilibrium point.\nProof: First we consider the decoding order D 1 . Let (R 1 , R 2 ) ∈ Γ ∩ B(C(D 1 )). In Proposition 1 we have proved that if (R 1 , R 2 ) ∈ Γ, then (R 1 , R 2 ) is not a Nash equilibrium point. So, it is sufﬁcient to consider a rate pair (R 1 , R 2 ) such that (R 1 , R 2 ) ∈ Γ but (R 1 , R 2 ) ∈ B(C(D 1 )), i.e., (R 1 , R 2 ) is in the interior of C(D 1 ). Suppose that (R 1 , R 2 ) is an equilibrium point. Since the users are selﬁsh and rational, R 10 = C K 2 10 P 10 1+K 2\nand R 20 = C K 2 20 P 20 (otherwise users can increase their rates upto this upper bound without affecting the other user\u2019s transmission). Since (R 1 , R 2 ) is in the interior, R 12 + R 21 < ˆ R 12 + ˆ R 21 (If not, (R 1 , R 2 ) will be a boundary point as argued in the proof of Proposition 2). However, in this case, user 1 can re-distribute his power to increase his rate R 12 without affecting user 2\u2019s rate, as argued in the proof of Proposition 2. Thus, user 1 can unilaterally deviate and increase his utility. Thus, (R 1 , R 2 ) cannot be an equilibrium point.\nWe can prove the same result for all other decoding orders D 2 , . . . , D 6 by similar arguments. These proofs are thus omitted.\nNow, putting the Propositions 2 and 3, we have the following characterization of the Nash equilibrium rates\nTheorem 1. Suppose the decoding order is D i , 1 ≤ i ≤ 6. Then a rate pair (R 1,D i , R 2,D i ) is a Nash equilibrium point if and only if (R 1,D i , R 2,D i ) ∈ Γ ∩ B(C(D i ))\nThe achievable region of the GGR channel, C, is given by the convex hull of the achievable regions C(D i ), 1 ≤ i ≤ 6. Thus any point in C is obtained by time sharing among the various decoding order as explained in Section II-B. Once the receiver announces α, each user decides their strategies for each of the decoding order. Note that each user can also decide their strategies for each decoding order just before the beginning of each decoding order. Thus there will be six decision making instants for each user and such a formulation comes under dynamic games. However we will be able to show that the equilibrium rates will not change. We are omitting the discussion about dynamic game formulation due to space constraints.\nNow, using Theorem 1, we give the complete char- acterization of the Nash equilibrium region of the GGR channel.\nTheorem 2. For the GGR channel, a rate pair (R 1 , R 2 ) is a Nash equilibrium rate pair if and only if (R 1 , R 2 ) =\nα i (R 1,D i , R 2,D i ) for some α := (α 1 , . . . , α 6 ) such that 6 i=1 α i = 1 where (R 1,D i , R 2,D i ) ∈ Γ ∩ B(C(D i )) for all i, 1 ≤ i ≤ 6.\nProof: If α := (α 1 , . . . , α 6 ) is the time shar- ing parameter vector and (R 1,D i , R 2,D i ) is the rate pair achieved during the time ( i−1 j=1 α j , i j=1 α j ] with decoding order D i , then the net rate is (R 1 , R 2 ) =\nα i (R 1,D i , R 2,D i ). Thus, by deﬁnition, any rate pair (R 1 , R 2 ) ∈ C if and only if (R 1 , R 2 ) =\nα i (R 1,D i , R 2,D i ) for some α := (α 1 , . . . , α 6 ) such that 6 i=1 α i = 1 and (R 1,D i , R 2,D i ) ∈ C(D i ).\nAssume that (R 1,D i , R 2,D i ) ∈ Γ ∩ B(C(D i )) for all i, 1 ≤ i ≤ 6. Then by Theorem 1 (R 1,D i , R 2,D i ) is a Nash equilibrium point during the time ( i−1 j=1 α j , i j=1 α j ] and hence no user will deviate during this time. This is true for 1 ≤ i ≤ 6 and hence for the entire time. Hence the rate pair (R 1 , R 2 ) = 6 i=1 α i (R 1,D i , R 2,D i ) for some α := (α 1 , . . . , α 6 ) such that 6 i=1 α i = 1 where (R 1,D i , R 2,D i ) ∈ Γ ∩ B(C(D i )) is a Nash equilibrium point.\nNow, let (R 1 , R 2 ) = \t 6 i=1 α i (R 1,D i , R 2,D i ) for some α := (α 1 , . . . , α 6 ) such that 6 i=1 α i = 1 but (R 1,D j , R 2,D j ) ∈ Γ ∩ B(C(D j )) for some k, 1 ≤ k ≤ 6. Then, by Theorem 1 (R 1,D k , R 2,D k ) is not a Nash equilibrium point. Then user 1 or user 2 can have a unilateral deviation during the time ( k−1 j=1 α j , k j=1 α j ] to increase his net rate. Thus, the rate pair (R 1 , R 2 ) =\nCorollary 1. If the rate pair (R 1 , R 2 ) ∈ Γ ∩ B(C) then (R 1 , R 2 ) is a Nash equilibrium point.\nProof: If (R 1 , R 2 ) ∈ B(C) then it can be achieved only by time sharing among the rates (R 1,D i , R 2,D i ) such that (R 1,D i , R 2,D i ) ∈ B(C(D i )). Then, by The- orem 2 the result follows.\nRemark: Not all equilibrium points are on the Pareto- optimal boundary of the achievable region C. Since any rate achieved by time sharing among the points of B(C(D i )), 1 ≤ i ≤ 6, is an equilibrium point and some decoding orders are inferior to others in some regions, we can have Nash equilibrium points that are not on the Pareto-optimal boundary of C.\nWe have established that all rate pairs (R 1 , R 2 ) such that R i ≥ R i,min , i = 1, 2 which are on the Pareto- optimal boundary of the achievable region of the gener- alized Gaussian relay channel correspond to a NE of the communication game between the users of the channel. However these are not the only NE rate points. We have showed that there are Nash equilibrium points in the interior of the achievable region of the GGR channel. In future work we will also generalize the results to more than two users, and for other cooperative communication schemes. Since the users can choose strategies before the beginning of each decoding order"},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"Y. E. Sagduyu"},{"name":"E.
