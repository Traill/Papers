Each code vector c l = (c l,0 , · · · , c l,K−1 ) T , 0 ≤ l ≤ N − 1, has unit-norm, i.e., ||c l || = \t K−1 i=0 |c l,i | 2 = 1, where T denotes the transpose. For the applications, we need a codebook C minimizing I max (C) or the maximum magnitude of inner products between a pair of distinct code vectors. To evaluate an (N, K) codebook C, it is therefore important to ﬁnd the minimum achievable I max (C) or its lower bound. The Welch bound [1] provides\nthe Welch bound, then C is called a maximum-Welch-bound- equality (MWBE) codebook [2].\nThe MWBE codebook, also known as an equiangular tight frame [3], has been of interest in many research areas, e.g., synchronous code-division multiple access (CDMA) sys- tems [4], Grassmanian packings [5], compressed sensing [6], and quantum computing [7]. Unfortunately, constructing an MWBE codebook in an analytic way is known to be extremely difﬁcult [2]. Therefore, numerous attempts have been made to present a near-optimal codebook C, where I max (C) asymptot- ically achieves the Welch bound equality for sufﬁciently large N . A number of construction examples based on codes and signal sets can be found in [2]. Ding and Feng [8][9] also pre- sented several near-optimal codebooks from almost difference sets. Generalizing this idea, Zhang and Feng [10][11] further constructed near-optimal codebooks with almost difference sets and cyclotomic classes. Recently, the author of this paper constructed near-optimal partial Fourier and Hadamard code- books [12] associated with binary Sidelnikov sequences [13].\nThis paper presents a new class of near-optimal (N, K) partial Fourier codebooks, where N = K 2 − 1 and K = 2 k for a positive integer k. We create a K × N partial Fourier matrix by selecting K rows from the N × N inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) matrix, where each code vector of a codebook C is equivalent to a column of the partial matrix. Exploiting the array structure of binary m-sequences of period N , we determine a set of the selected row indices for C. Moreover, it is found that the row index set for C is a union of several cyclotomic cosets modulo N. A theoretical study of the codebook C shows that the magnitude of inner products between distinct code vectors is two-valued, and its maximum nearly achieves the Welch bound equality for sufﬁciently large N . Therefore, C is a new near-optimal codebook or nearly equiangular tight frame with N = K 2 − 1, which may ﬁnd its potential applications in many research ﬁelds.\n− Z N = {0, 1, · · · , N − 1} is a ring of integers modulo N , and Z + N = Z N \\ {0}.\n− F q = GF(q) is a ﬁnite ﬁeld with q elements and F ∗ q = F q \\ {0}.\n− Let p be prime, and m and k be positive integers with k | m.

Throughout this paper, we assume cyclotomic cosets modulo N over F 2 , where N is odd.\n1) Deﬁnition: A binary m-sequence is a class of binary se- quences with ideal two-level autocorrelation [15] −[17], which is a characteristic sequence of a cyclic difference set [18]. Let a = (a 0 , · · · , a 2 m −2 ) be a binary m-sequence of period 2 m − 1, where a t ∈ Z 2 , 0 ≤ t ≤ 2 m − 2. Then, its (periodic) autocorrelation function is given by\nAlgebraically, a binary m-sequence of period 2 m − 1 is represented by a single-term trace function [16][17], i.e.,\na t = Tr m 1 (γα t ), t = 0, 1, · · · , 2 m − 2 \t (1) where α is a primitive element in F 2 m and γ ∈ F ∗ 2 m . In (1), we call Tr m 1 (γx) the trace representation of the binary m- sequence a [17], where Tr m 1 (γx) generates a while x runs through F ∗ 2 m .\n2) Array structure of binary m-sequences: For m = 2k, let α be a primitive element in F 2 m . Let a = (a 0 , · · · , a 2 m −2 ) be a binary m-sequence of period 2 m − 1, where a t = Tr m 1 (α t ) for 0 ≤ t ≤ 2 m − 2. For d = 2 k + 1, note that β = α d is a primitive element in F 2 k . Letting t = di + v,\nTr m k (α v ) = 0, \t if v = 0, β e v , if 1 ≤ v ≤ 2 k \t (3) where 0 ≤ e v ≤ 2 k − 2. From (2) and (3), it is easily checked that the binary m-sequence a has a (2 k − 1) × (2 k + 1) array structure with row index i and column index v [17]. In the array, the ﬁrst column sequence of v = 0 is all zero sequence of length 2 k −1, while the vth column sequence for 1 ≤ v ≤ 2 k is a cyclic e v -shift of a binary m-sequence of period 2 k − 1, represented by Tr k 1 β i+e v for 0 ≤ i ≤ 2 k − 2. 3) Fourier transforms of binary m-sequences: Let a =\n(a 0 , · · · , a N −1 ) be a binary sequence of length N , where a t ∈ Z 2 , 0 ≤ t ≤ N −1. Then, the N -point inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) of a is deﬁned as a = (a 0 , · · · , a N −1 ) with\nwhere j = √ −1. If l = 0, note that a 0 = N −1 t=0 (−1) a t = N − 2wt(a).\nThe N-point IDFT of a binary sequence with ideal two-level autocorrelation is determined as follows.\nProposition 1: Let a be a binary sequence of period N ≡ 3 (mod 4) with ideal two-level autocorrelation, where its sup- port is an (N, N −1 2 , N −3 4 ) (or equivalently (N, N +1 2 , N +1 4 )) cyclic difference set. The N-point IDFT of a is then given by\nWe believe that Proposition 1 has been implicitly known to many researchers in this ﬁeld, where its proof is straight- forward from Corollary 1 in [12]. Proposition 1 implies that a binary m-sequence of period N = 2 m − 1 has the ﬂat spectrum of the N-point IDFT at its nonzero indices, where the magnitude is √ 2 m .\nThe following notations are used throughout this paper. − k is a positive integer and m = 2k.\n− N = 2 m − 1, M = 2 k − 1, d = N/M = 2 k + 1, and K = 2 k .\n− α is a primitive element in F 2 m and β = α d is a primitive element in F 2 k .\n− e v is an integer determined by (3), where 0 ≤ e v ≤ 2 k − 2.\nThe Fourier spectrum of a binary m-sequence of period N = 2 m − 1 has an interesting decomposition property if the sequence has the array structure for m = 2k.\nLemma 1: Let a = (a 0 , · · · , a N −1 ) be a binary m- sequence of period N, where a t = Tr m 1 (α t ) for 0 ≤ t ≤ N −1. In its (2 k − 1) × (2 k + 1) array structure, the vth column se- quence b (v) = (b (v) 0 , · · · , b (v) M−1 ) is also a binary m-sequence of period M for 1 ≤ v ≤ 2 k . Let b = (b 0 , · · · , b M−1 ) be a binary m-sequence of period M, where b i = Tr k 1 (β i ) for 0 ≤ i ≤ M − 1. Recall that b (v) is a cyclic e v -shift of b, i.e., b (v) i = b i+e v for 0 ≤ i ≤ M − 1. Let a = (a 0 , · · · , a N −1 ) and b = (b 0 , · · · , b M−1 ) be the N -point and the M -point IDFTs of a and b, respectively. Then, if l ≡ 0 (mod M),\nProof: Let t = di + v be the element index of a, where 0 ≤ i ≤ M − 1 and 0 ≤ v ≤ d − 1. Then, we can arrange the addition of its N-point IDFT columnwise, i.e.,\nClearly, M−1 i=0 e j 2πdil N = M−1 i=0 e j 2πil M = 0 for l ≡ 0 (mod M ). Thus, (5) becomes\nProof: Recall from Proposition 1 that the binary m-sequences a and b have the ﬂat spectrums of the N-point and the M- point IDFTs, respectively, at their nonzero indices. Therefore, if l ≡ 0 (mod M), (4) yields\nTo construct a new partial Fourier codebook, we deﬁne an index set R = {r v ≡ de v − v mod N | 1 ≤ v ≤ 2 k }, in order to select the corresponding rows from the N-point IDFT matrix. In what follows, we study its structure.\nLemma 2: Let C u i be a cyclotomic coset modulo 2 k + 1 with a coset leader u i . Assume that Z + d is partitioned into δ cyclotomic cosets modulo 2 k + 1, i.e., Z + d = {1, · · · , 2 k } =\n. For given u i , 1 ≤ i ≤ δ, let z i ∈ Z + 2 m −1 be an integer such that\nα z i = 1 + α (2 k −1)u i . \t (7) Assume z i ∈ C s i , where C s i is a cyclotomic coset modulo 2 m − 1 with a coset leader s i . Clearly, z i = z j if and only if u i = u j for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ δ. Moreover, |C s i | = |C u i | for each i, 1 ≤ i ≤ δ. Then we say that C s i is associated with C u i . Finally, the index set R is partitioned into δ cyclotomic cosets modulo 2 m − 1, i.e.,\nProof: For given u i ∈ Z + d , it is obvious that z i meeting (7) is unique from the structure of the ﬁnite ﬁeld F 2 m . From the uniqueness, z i = z j if and only if u i = u j for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ δ.\nLet |C u i | = n u i and |C s i | = n s i , where u i ≡ u i 2 n ui (mod 2 k + 1) and s i ≡ s i 2 n si (mod 2 m − 1). Then, 1 +\n= α z i 2 nui . Since 1+α (2 k −1)·u i 2 nui = 1+α (2 k −1)·u i = α z i , we have α z i 2 nui = α z i , which implies z i 2 n ui ≡ z i (mod 2 m −1). With z i ∈ C s i , it is clear that n s i | n u i . Similarly, 1 + α (2 k −1)·u i 2 nsi =\n= α z i 2 nsi = α z i = 1 + α (2 k −1)·u i . Then, u i 2 n si ≡ u i (mod 2 k + 1), which implies n u i | n s i . With n s i | n u i and n u i | n s i , we have n u i = n s i , or equivalently |C u i | = |C s i | for each i, 1 ≤ i ≤ δ.\n= α −v · (α v + α v·2 k ) = 1 + α (2 k −1)v .\nThus, if v = u i , then r v = z i from (7) and (8). Moreover, from 1 + α (2 k −1)·2v = α 2r v , it is easy to see that r v takes on every value of C s i while v runs through C u i . Finally, if v runs through Z + d = 1≤i≤δ C u i , it is clear that r v generated by (8) constitutes δ cyclotomic cosets of C s 1 , · · · , C s δ each of which is associated with C u 1 , · · · , C u δ , respectively. 2\n|C u i | = |Z + d | = 2 k , which conﬁrms that all the elements of R are distinct.\nCorollaries 1 and 2 lead us to the main contribution of this paper, that is, the construction of a new (N, K) partial Fourier codebook with N = K 2 − 1 that nearly achieves the Welch bound equality.\nConstruction 1: Let R = {r v ≡ de v − v mod N | 1 ≤ v ≤ 2 k } be an index set, where |R| = 2 k . Consider a K × N partial Fourier matrix selecting K rows from the N -point IDFT matrix, where the selected row indices are from R. With the scaling factor 1 √ K , the lth column vector of the partial Fourier matrix is given as\nwhere 0 ≤ l ≤ N − 1. Then, C = (c 0 , c 1 , · · · , c N −1 ) is an (N, K) partial Fourier codebook with N = K 2 − 1, which is also equivalent to a tight frame [3].\nTheorem 1: In the (N, K) codebook C from Construction 1, the magnitude of inner products between c l 1 and c l 2 , 0 ≤ l 1 = l 2 ≤ N − 1, is two-valued, i.e.,\n, if l 2 − l 1 ≡ 0 mod M which yields\nProof: From (9), the inner product of a pair of distinct code vectors is given by\nwhere l = l 2 − l 1 = 0. Without loss of generality, we assume l 1 < l 2 and 1 ≤ l ≤ N − 1.\nc H l 1 c l 2 = 1 √ K . \t (10) On the other hand, if l ≡ 0 (mod M), let l = yM, where y ≡ 0 (mod d) for 1 ≤ l ≤ N − 1. Then,\nwhere we used 2 k v=1 e −j 2πvy d = 1 with d = 2 k + 1. From (10) and (11), the proof is completed. \t 2\n≈ 1 √ K+1 . Thus, I max (C) = 1 √ K of Theorem 1 nearly achieves the Welch bound equality for large N.\nLemma 2 shows that one may generate the index set R using cyclotomic cosets over F 2 . In the following, we show an example of how to construct a new partial Fourier codebook in Construction 1 through the technique of cyclotomic cosets.\nExample 1: Let k = 3 and m = 6. Let α be a primitive element in F 2 6 , which is a root of primitive polynomial x 6 + x + 1. Then, cyclotomic cosets modulo 9 partitioning Z + 9 are C 1 = {1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5} and C 3 = {3, 6} from which the set of nonzero coset leaders is Γ 2 (9) = {1, 3}. With u 1 = 1, (7) becomes α z 1 = 1 + α 7 = α 26 from which z 1 = 26. Therefore, a cyclotomic coset modulo 63 associated with C 1 is C 13 = {13, 26, 52, 41, 19, 38}, where s 1 = 13. Similarly, with u 2 = 3, we have α z 2 = 1 + α 21 = α 42 , so z 2 = 42. Thus, associated with C 3 , C 21 = {21, 42}, where s 2 = 21. Finally, the index set is given by\nwhich is used to construct a (63, 8) partial Fourier codebook C in Construction 1, where I max (C) = 1 √ K = 1 √ 8 .\nWe can check that changing a primitive polynomial or primitive element α in F 2 m yields different index sets in Lemma 2. Note that the number of primitive polynomials over F 2 of degree m is φ(2 m −1) m [17], where φ(x) is the Euler- totient function denoting the number of integers from 1 to x which are relatively prime to x. Therefore, employing different primitive polynomials, we obtain total φ(2 m −1) m different index sets for given m = 2k. Moreover, each index set R has its cyclic equivalence class of R + τ = {r v + τ | r v ∈ R} for 0 ≤ τ ≤ 2 m − 2, which does not change the correspond- ing I max (C). Consequently, Construction 1 presents at most (2 m − 1)· φ(2 m −1) m partial Fourier codebooks nearly achieving the Welch bound equality.\nRemark 1: In theory and practice, an (N, K) MWBE code- book C (or equiangular tight frame) with N = K 2 is of particular interest, where I max (C) = 1 √ K+1 . Xia et al. [19] showed that an (N, K) partial Fourier codebook is MWBE if and only if cyclic difference sets [18] are used for selecting the K rows from the N -point IDFT matrix. In this case, however, the parameter N is at most N = K 2 − K + 1 for given K. To obtain a codebook with N = K 2 , one may employ a K × K 2 discrete-chirp matrix [20], or equivalently the Alltop-Garbor frame [5][21], which turns out to be a near-optimal codebook C achieving I max (C) = 1 √ K for a prime integer K.\nIn addition to the well known codebooks, Construction 1 presents a new near-optimal (N, K) partial Fourier codebook C achieving I max (C) = 1 √ K , where the parameters are N = K 2 − 1 and K = 2 k for a positive integer k. We believe that the new partial Fourier codebook, equivalent to a nearly equiangular tight frame, may be of interest in many research ﬁelds, by meeting the Welch bound equality asymptotically and providing composite parameters of N and K.\nRemark 2: The near-optimal partial Fourier codebook in Construction 1 has been generalized in [22] for K = p k and N = K 2 − 1 for any prime p and a positive integer k. In the generalized codebook, the magnitude of inner products between distinct code vectors is also two-valued, and its max- imum nearly achieves the Welch bound equality. Therefore, a larger number of near-optimal codebooks with various K and N can be presented by the generalization. In [22], it is also shown that the row index set forms a new almost difference set [23] for any prime p, and the near-optimality of the codebook is established through the almost difference set. Moreover, it turns out that each element of the index set is obtained by a decimation of an N-ary Sidelnikov sequence [13] of length N with decimation factor K − 1. For more details on the generalization, see [22].\nThis paper has presented a new near-optimal (N, K) partial Fourier codebook C, where N = K 2 − 1 and K = 2 k for a positive integer k. To determine a set of the selected row indices for C, we exploited the spectral decomposition of binary m-sequences with the array structure. A theoretical study of Fourier transforms showed that the magnitude of inner products between distinct code vectors in C is two-valued and I max (C) = 1 √ K nearly achieves the Welch bound equality. With the near-optimal I max (C) and the composite parameters of N and K, the new partial Fourier codebook C may ﬁnd its potential applications in many research areas, particularly in deterministic compressed sensing where a tight frame with nearly optimal coherence [24] is required for a sensing matrix."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"L.
