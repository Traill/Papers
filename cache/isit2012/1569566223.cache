This connection allows the MAP threshold, for the binary erasure channel, to be evaluated efﬁciently via an upper bound that can be shown to be tight in some cases.\nIn this paper, a similar analysis is used to extend these results to several multiuser systems, namely a noisy Slepian- Wolf problem and a multiple-access channel with erasures. The simplicity of these channel models allows for rigorous analysis and enables the derivation of upper bounds on the MAP thresholds using EXIT area theorems. In some cases, one can also show these bounds are tight. One interesting application is that the MAP thresholds can be compared with the BP thresholds of spatially-coupled codes to verify threshold saturation for the corresponding systems."},"body":{"text":"The graph structure of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes leads naturally to belief propagation (BP), a low- complexity message-passing decoding, which is optimal if the graph has no cycles. On the other hand, maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding is globally optimal but its com- plexity is prohibitively large in many scenarios. Associated with each decoder is a maximum noise threshold, below which it is possible to have reliable communication. In many cases, there is a gap between the BP and MAP thresholds [1]. Evaluating these two thresholds, for an iterative decoding system, is an important part of understanding the codes and decoding algorithms.\nAn interesting example is the threshold saturation phe- nomenon of spatially-coupled (SC) LDPC codes, whereby the BP threshold improves to the MAP threshold [2]. While determining the BP threshold is straightforward via density- evolution (DE) analysis, evaluating the MAP threshold di- rectly is problematic due to complexity issues. Fortunately, for LDPC codes on the binary erasure channel (BEC), a fundamental relationship between the BP and MAP thresh- olds can be found using extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) curves. One can use this connection to upper bound the MAP threshold [3]. This bounding technique has now been used in various point-to-point communication problems [4], [5], [6] and also to evaluate the MAP threshold of turbo codes [7].\nIn this paper, we use a similar analysis to evaluate the MAP thresholds of LDPC codes over two multiuser systems: the noisy Slepian-Wolf (SW) problem and the two-user multiple- access channel (MAC). For more realistic noise models, one can use generalized EXIT (GEXIT) analysis to compute\nupper bounds on the MAP thresholds [8], [9]. This paper focuses, however, on the erasure noise models. The simplicity of these toy models allows one to perform a thorough analysis and provide insights into the general case. For each problem, we derive the appropriate EXIT curve and use the natural area theorem to obtain an upper bound on the MAP threshold. We then provide a counting argument that allows numerical veriﬁcation of the bound\u2019s tightness.\nAs mentioned earlier, one direct application of this analysis is veriﬁcation of the threshold saturation phenomenon, the underlying mechanism behind the impressive performance of SC codes. While the BP thresholds of SC were recently observed to get close to the Shannon limits of these consid- ered problems [8], [10], with the MAP threshold evaluated here, one can see that the BP thresholds of SC codes saturate not just to some value that can be close to the \u201ccapacity\u201d but this value turn outs to be exactly the MAP threshold of the underlying ensemble. Since the MAP thresholds can be shown to converge to the Shannon limit as the node degrees increase, it is not surprising that SC codes can achieve the entire capacity region of the corresponding problems.\nThe degree distribution (d.d.) of a standard LDPC en- semble is deﬁned, from the edge perspective, by the pair of polynomials ( λ, ρ) and, from the node perspective, by ( L, R) [1]. The LDPC ensemble of length n with d.d. (λ, ρ) is denoted by LDPC( n, λ, ρ). We also consider two edge type LDPC ensembles [11] whose d.d.s are deﬁned by\nwhere L i 1 ,i 2 gives the fraction of bit nodes with i j outgoing edges of type j and R [j] i gives the fraction of check nodes with i edges of type j for j ∈ {1, 2}.\nThroughout this paper, X [j] is used to denote a vector of bits where [ j] indicates user (or channel) j for j ∈ {1, 2}. Likewise, X [j] i represents the ith bit and X [j] is sometimes used if the bit index is not emphasized. For simplicity, X [j] ∼i is used when the ith bit is omitted from the vector X [j] . An erasure is denoted by ?. For SC codes, the (l , r, L, w) ensemble deﬁned in [2] is considered. Due to the space limitation, many of the results in this paper are presented without complete proofs and the details can be found in [12].\nTwo correlated discrete memoryless sources are encoded by two independent linear encoding functions of identical design rate r. These encoders map k input symbols (U [1]\nand U [2] ) to n output symbols (X [1] and X [2] ) which are then transmitted through two independent channels. A central location receives (Y [1] , Y [2] ) and jointly decodes them to (U [1] , U [2] ). In the model we consider, the two channels are BECs with erasure rate [1] and [2] , respectively. That is\nY [j] i = X [j] i with probability 1 − [j] i , ? \t with probability [j] i ,\n= [2] for all i. We also consider an erasure correlation model between the two sources. More speciﬁcally, let Z be a Bernoulli-p random variable then the two sources are the same Bernoulli- 1 2 random variable if Z = 1 and are i.i.d. Bernoulli- 1 2 random variables if Z = 0. The decoder is assumed to have access to the side information Z. The Slepian-Wolf region is given in [8] by\n2 |U 1 ) r = 1 − (1 − p)r, [2] ≤ 1 − H(U\n1 |U 2 ) r = 1 − (1 − p)r, [1] + [2] ≤ 2 − H(U\nAssume that the sequences U [1] and U [2] are encoded by LDPC codes with the same d.d. ( λ, ρ) using a punctured systematic encoder. The fraction of punctured systematic bits is γ = 1 − L (1) R (1) (see more discussion in [8]). After puncturing, the two codes have rate r = γ 1−γ . The Tanner graph for an LDPC code and the SW problem with erasures (SWE) is given by Fig. 1.\nIf the joint BP decoder is used, one has the following DE ﬁxed-point (f.p.) equation (see [8])\nwhere f (t) (1 − p) + pt and y(t) 1 − ρ(1 − t). Here, x 1 (resp. x 2 ) is the average erasure rate of messages from bit nodes to check nodes corresponding to source 1 (resp. 2) in the limit of inﬁnite block length and inﬁnite number of BP iterations. From this, one can write\n1 , x 2 ) = [ x 1 /λ(y(x 1 )) − γf (L(y(x 2 )))] /(1 − γ), [2] ( x\nLet us express x 1 ( x) and x 2 ( x) according to a common parameter x, say x = x 1 , and consider a smooth curve C from ( x 1 (1) , x 2 (1)) = (1 , 1) decreasing in both arguments. This curve C can be characterized by a single parameter ∈ [0 , 1], say = ( [1] + [2] ) /2, and = 1 corresponds to the\ncase ( [1] , [2] ) = (1 , 1). Many steps in analysis, presented in Section II, are based on this assumption for the curve C. B. EXIT Functions\nDeﬁnition 1: Consider a sequence of LDPC( n, λ, ρ) en- sembles. For each n, pick C n uniformly at random from LDPC( n, λ, ρ) and let X [1] , X [2] be chosen uniformly from C n . Let Y n 1 be the received sequence after transmission over the SWE with erasure rate pair ( [1] , [2] ) characterized by a common parameter . The (MAP-)EXIT function (associated with C n ) is deﬁned by\nTheorem 1: The above deﬁnition of the EXIT function naturally gives an area theorem as follows ˆ\nh( )d = H(U [1] , U [2] ) r = (2 − p)r given a uniform prior on the codeword sets.\nWhen the BP estimator is used instead of the MAP estima- tor, one also has the BP-EXIT function. The asymptotic BP- EXIT function can be obtained by taking the average BP- EXIT function over all the codes C n and taking n → ∞ and followed by the number of BP iterations → ∞. Using the concentration theorem and the fact that, for a ﬁxed number of iterations, the computation graph for a speciﬁc bit becomes tree-like as n → ∞, one can compute the asymptotic BP- EXIT function as follows.\nwhere ( x 1 , x 2 ) is the f.p. pair at channel erasure rate pair ( [1] ( ) , [2] ( )).\nGenerally speaking, the MAP threshold (along the curve C) can be deﬁned as the supremum of all parameters such that h( ) = 0. Likewise, one can deﬁne the BP threshold. By the optimality of the MAP decoder, one can invoke the data processing inequality [13] and have the following lemma.\nLemma 3: For the SWE, one has 0 ≤ h( ) ≤ h BP ( ) ≤ 2 . Remark 1: With the above analysis, one can use a similar\napproach to [3] to obtain an upper bound on the MAP threshold. More speciﬁcally, by ﬁnding the largest ¯ MAP such that\nh BP ( )d = H(U [1] , U [2] ) r, one has MAP ≤ ¯ MAP which follows from\nh BP ( )d = H(U [1] , U [2] ) r ≤\nTo compute the area under the BP-EXIT curve, it is more convenient to consider the extended BP (EBP) EXIT curve that extends the BP-EXIT by also including the unstable f.p.s.\nDeﬁnition 2: The EBP-EXIT curve for the SWE is de- ﬁned by ( x), L(y(x 1 ( x))) d [1] d ( x) + L(y(x 2 ( x))) d [2] d ( x)\nfor x ∈ [0, 1] where the second coordinate is called the EBP- EXIT function h EBP ( x).\nThe area under the BP-EXIT curve can be computed with the help of a \u201ctrial entropy\u201d as follows.\nh EBP ( t)d (t) denote the \u201ctrial entropy\u201d. Then, (1 − γ)P (x) equals\nwhere [j] and x j are also functions of x for j ∈ {1, 2}. Corollary 1: The EBP-EXIT satisﬁes the area theorem ˆ\nCorollary 2: If x MAP is the unique positive root of P (x) = 0, then ¯ MAP ( x MAP ) ≥ MAP upper bounds the MAP thresh- old because\nIf one considers regular LDPC ensembles of a ﬁxed rate, using the property P (x MAP ) = 0 , the following lemma shows that, for sufﬁciently high degrees, ¯ MAP approaches the Shannon limit.\nLemma 5: Consider a sequence of (l , r)-regular ensem- bles where l → ∞ and the rate r = 1 − l r is ﬁxed. Then, we have ¯ MAP (l , r) → Sh ( r) where Sh ( r) corresponds to the boundary of the SW region along the curve C.\nLemma 6: Assume the joint BP decoder is run until it reaches a f.p. Remove all known bits and merge pairs of aligned bits that have the same value into larger bit nodes and obtain a residual graph. The residual graph can be seen as a two edge type LDPC ensemble and its expected d.d. (normalized with respect to the original graph) is 1\n˜ R [1] ( z) = R(1−x 1 + zx 1 ) − R(1−x 1 ) − zx 1 R (1−x 1 ) , ˜ R [2] ( z) = R(1−x 2 + zx 2 ) − R(1−x 2 ) − zx 2 R (1−x 2 ) ,\nwhere ( x 1 , x 2 ) is the f.p. at erasure rate pair ( [1] ( ) , [2] ( )) and y 1 y(x 1 ) and y 2 y(x 2 ) .\nTheorem 2: At = ¯ MAP , the design rate of the residual graph equals zero.\nL (1) R (1)\nTherefore, one can see from (1), Lemma 4 and Corollary 2 that ˜ r ¯ MAP = (1 − γ)P (x MAP ) / ˜ L ¯ MAP (1 , 1) = 0.\nRemark 2: To show the tightness of the MAP upper bound, it remains to be shown that the actual rate of the\nresidual graph is zero because if this is true, the MAP decoder should decode perfectly for all < ¯ MAP . One can use the test in [11] to numerically verify this fact. For simplicity, we focus on the curve C that extends linearly from (1 , 1) according to 1− [1] = A(1− [2] ) for some A > 0 where, e.g., A = 1 represents the symmetric channel condition. In Fig. 2 (a), the function θ(e 1 , e 2 ) (see [11, p. 11] for deﬁnition) for the residual graph d.d. is plotted for the case A = 3 2 and one can see that the maximum of θ(e 1 , e 2 ) over the unit square is zero. Thus, the actual rate of the residual graph equals its design rate, which is zero, with high probability as n → ∞. This implies that the upper bound is tight and MAP = ¯ MAP .\nIn this section, we consider the two-user MAC channel with erasure noise (EMAC) discussed in [10] and evaluate the MAP threshold when the two users transmit LDPC codes. Let the inputs X [1] i , X [2] i ∈ {±1} then the output is given by\nY i = X [1] i + X [2] i \t Z i with probability 1 − i , ? \t with probability i ,\nwhere erasure rate i = for all i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n}. The achievable rate region for the rate pair ( r 1 , r 2 ) of the two users is characterized by\nand therefore the Shannon limit, i.e., the supremum of all erasure rates that allows reliable communication for both users, is Sh ( r 1 , r 2 ) = min 1 − r 1 , 1 − r 2 , 1 − 2 3 ( r 1 + r 2 ) .\nWe consider X [j] to be chosen uniformly at random from LDPC( n, λ [j] , ρ [j] ) for j ∈ {1, 2}, respectively. If one uses the joint BP decoder operating on the Tanner graph in Fig. 3, then the DE f.p. equation is given by\nwhere x j is the expected erasure rate of the messages from bit nodes to check nodes corresponding to user j (in the limit of inﬁnite block length and inﬁnite number of BP iterations) and y j ( x j ) 1 − ρ [j] (1 − x j ) for j = 1, 2. One can express the f.p. pair ( x 1 , x 2 ) as a function of a common parameter x, say x = x 1 . Thus, one can write ( x), x 1 ( x) and x 2 ( x) to emphasize the dependence on x and note that (1) = 1. With some abuse of notation, we write y j ( x) as a shorthand notation of y j ( x j ( x)) for j = 1, 2.\nDeﬁnition 3: Consider sequences of LDPC( n, λ [1] , ρ [1] ) and LDPC( n, λ [2] , ρ [2] ) ensembles. For each n, pick C [j] n\nuniformly at random from LDPC( n, λ [j] , ρ [j] ). Let X [j] be chosen uniformly from C [j] n for j ∈ {1, 2} and Y be the received sequence at the output of the EMAC with erasure probability . The MAP-EXIT function (associated with C [1] n\nTheorem 3: The deﬁnition of the EXIT function leads to an area theorem that says\nh( )d = r 1 + r 2 given a uniform prior on the set of the codewords.\nLemma 7: The EXIT function, h( ), for the EMAC equals 1 n\nand observe that the second term does not depend on i . Thus, assuming i = gives\nd d\nReplacing the MAP estimator with the BP estimator gives the BP-EXIT function for this problem. The asymptotic BP- EXIT function is obtained by taking the expectation over the codes C [1] n , C [2] n , the limit as the blocklength goes to inﬁnity, and the limit as the number of BP iterations goes to inﬁnity.\nBy invoking the concentration theorem and the tree-like property of the computation graph for a bit node, one can\ncompute the asymptotic BP-EXIT function as given in the following lemma.\nLemma 8: For BP estimator, the (asymptotic) BP-EXIT function, h BP ( ), equals\nL [1] ( y 1 ( x 1 ))+ L [2] ( y 2 ( x 2 ))− L [1] ( y 1 ( x 1 )) L [2] ( y 2 ( x 2 )) /2, where ( x 1 , x 2 ) is the f.p. pair at channel erasure rate .\nThe MAP threshold MAP for the EMAC is deﬁned as the supremum of all channel parameters such that h( ) = 0. The BP threshold BP is deﬁned similarly.\nLemma 9: For the EMAC problem, one has 0 ≤ h( ) ≤ h BP ( ) ≤ 3 /2.\nThus, one can invoke the standard MAP bounding technique, i.e., ﬁnding the largest ¯ MAP such that\nh BP ( )d = r 1 + r 2 and obtaining MAP ≤ ¯ MAP as a result.\nTo conveniently compute the area under the BP-EXIT curve, we deﬁne the EBP-EXIT curve as follows.\n( x), L [1] ( y 1 ( x))+L [2] ( y 2 ( x))− 1 2\nfor x ∈ [0, 1] where the second coordinate is called the EBP- EXIT function h EBP ( x).\nh EBP ( t)d (t) denote the \u201ctrial entropy\u201d. Then, one ﬁnds that P (x) equals\nCorollary 3: The EBP-EXIT curve for the EMAC satisﬁes the area theorem\nCorollary 4: If x MAP is the unique positive root of P (x) = 0, then ¯ MAP \t ( x MAP ) ≥ MAP upper bounds the MAP threshold because\nAgain, by considering regular LDPC ensembles of a ﬁxed rate and using the property P (x MAP ) = 0, ¯ MAP can be shown to approach the Shannon limit.\nLemma 11: Consider a sequence of regular ensembles (i.e., (l [1] , r [1] ) and (l [2] , r [2] )) and assume l [j] → ∞ so that r j = (r [j] − l [j] ) /r [j] is ﬁxed (for j ∈ {1, 2}). Then, ¯ MAP (l [1] , r [1] , l [2] , r [2] ) → Sh ( r 1 , r 2 ).\nLemma 12: Assume the joint BP decoder is run until it reaches a ﬁxed point. Next, remove all the known bits and their adjacent edges and check nodes. Further, merge any pair of bit nodes at the same index that have the same value. The residual graph can be seen as a two edge type LDPC ensemble and its expected d.d. (normalized with respect to the original graph) is\n˜ R [1] ( z) =R [1] (1− x 1 + zx 1 )− R [1] (1− x 1 )− zx 1 R [1] (1− x 1 ) , ˜ R [2] ( z) =R [2] (1− x 2 + zx 2 )− R [2] (1− x 2 )− zx 2 R [2] (1− x 2 ) ,\n2 L = 8 L = 16\nTheorem 4: At erasure rate = ¯ MAP , the design rate of the residual graph ˜ r ¯ MAP equals zero.\nL [1] (1) R [1] (1)\n˜ R [1] (1)+ L [2] (1) R [2] (1)\nRemark 3: Similar to Remark 2, one can use the test in [11, p. 11] to show the tightness of the bound. For example, let us consider the case when user 1 and user 2 use the (3 , 6)-regular and (3, 9)-regular LDPC ensembles, respectively. From Fig. 2 (b), the maximum of θ(e 1 , e 2 ), for the corresponding residual graph, over the unit square is zero. Ths implies that the actual rate of the residual graph equals its design rate with high probability as n → ∞ and consequently, the MAP upper bound is tight.\nOne important application of our analysis is that one can compare the MAP thresholds of uncoupled LDPC ensembles with the BP thresholds of SC ensembles to observe the threshold saturation. This can be nicely seen by plotting the BP-EXIT curves for both the coupled and uncoupled systems.\nIn Fig. 4 (a), the BP-EXIT curves for the (4 , 6, L, 5) SC ensembles based on the punctured (4 , 6)-regular ensemble (see [8]) are plotted for the SWE with an asymmetric channel condition ( A = 3 2 ). It can be seen that as L increases, these curves saturate to the MAP threshold of the uncoupled system. Similarly, in Fig. 4 (b) for the EMAC, the BP-EXIT curves for the (3 , 6, 3, 9, L, 5) SC system, i.e., the two users use the (3 , 6, L, 5) and (3, 9, L, 9) ensembles respectively, also saturate to the MAP threshold of the uncoupled system. Similar plots for the SWE with symmetric channel conditions ( A = 1) and the EMAC with symmetric user rates (r 1 = r 2 ) are also given in [8], [10], bit without rigorous consideration of the MAP thresholds.\nThe main result of this paper is the MAP threshold evaluation and not the BP threshold of SC. Still, this analysis allows one to observe that the saturation point of the BP thresholds for SC equals the MAP threshold of the underlying ensembles for these two multiuser problems. In particular,\nthis calculation is required to make the above statement rigorous in our recent proof of threshold saturation for these systems [14]."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"T. J.
