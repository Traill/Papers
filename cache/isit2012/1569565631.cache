Although many works have been concerned on meeting the Welch bound with equality, no such effort has been reported for the Levenshtein bound. We show that the Levenshtein bound with equality is met if and only if the non-trivial aperiodic correlations have identical amplitude for all time-shifts, and the sequences form a novel class of complementary set whose aperiodic correlation is deﬁned as the conventional aperiodic correlation modulated by a simplex weighting vector."},"body":{"text":"Welch obtained the correlation lower bounds for equi- energy sequence sets based on the inner product theorem of the vector set [1]. Massey et al obtained the necessary and sufﬁcient condition of meeting the Welch bound (on total squared correlations) with equality [2],[3], and found that the sum capacity of synchronous code-division multiple- access (CDMA) system is maximized by the Welch bound equality (WBE) sequence sets [4]. Mow showed that for asynchronous CDMA system, the maximum worst-case signal- to-noise ratio (SNR) is met if and only if the sequences form a complementary set [5]-[7], which has zero non-trivial aperiodic correlation summations [8],[9]. Ever since then, a lot of works have been concerned on the WBE sequences [10]- [13].\nIn [14], Levenshtein proposed a lower bound on aperiodic correlation of binary sequence set by the inequality on the mean of the weighted squared correlations, and showed that it is tighter than the Welch bound for K ≥ 4 and N ≥ 2, where K denotes the sequence set size, and N the sequence length.\nIn this paper, we show how to meet the Levenshtein bound with equality by using a particular weighting vector, and when that equality is met, the sequences will form a weighted- correlation complementary set characterized by this weighting vector.\nNotations and deﬁnitions are given in Section II.A, followed by a brief review of the Levenshtein bound in Section II.B. The problem of meeting the Levenshtein bound with equality is studied in Section III, and then concluded in Section IV.\nDeﬁnition 1: Denote by ρ a u ,a v (τ ) the conventional aperi- odic correlation function of A as\nρ a u ,a v (τ ) =           \nWhen u = v, ρ a u ,a v (τ ) is called the aperiodic auto-correlation function, and will be written as ρ a u (τ ) for ease of presentation; otherwise, aperiodic cross-correlation function.\nfor τ ̸= 0, we say that the sequences of A form a conven- tional complementary set with zero non-trivial aperiodic auto- correlation summations.\nDeﬁnition 2: Denote by δ max the maximum non-trivial aperiodic correlation magnitude of A as\nDeﬁnition 3: A simplex weighting vector w = (w 0 , w 1 , · · · , w 2N −2 ) T is deﬁned as\nDeﬁnition 4: For the simplex weighting vector w deﬁned in (4), the weighted aperiodic auto-correlation function of A\nis deﬁned as ρ a u ;w,λ (τ ) =           \n(5) where 0 ≤ λ ≤ 2N − 2, and the subscript addition t + λ is performed modulo 2N − 1.

Moreover, the additional con- dition for the Levenshtein bound in (12) to be met with equal- ity is that all the non-trivial aperiodic correlation magnitudes of A should be identical.\nIn this paper, we have shown that the Levenshtein bound (for aperiodic correlation) is met with equality if and only if the sequences of the binary sequence set form a weighted- correlation complementary set and their non-trivial aperiodic correlations take identical amplitude for all time-shifts. The same conclusion can also be easily shown to hold for sequence sets over complex roots-of-unity whose alphabet phases are more than 2 [15], yet the proof is omitted.\nAs expected, meeting the Levenshtein bound with equality is more stringent, and the search for the bound-achieving sequence set remains an open problem. For such bound- achieving sequence set, however, we note that:\n1) If such a bound-achieving sequence set exists, the cor- responding weighting vector, with which those bound- achieving sequences form a weighted-correlation com- plementary set, will be the one which maximizes the Levenshtein bound over all the weighting vectors.\n2) For an arbitrary weighting vector w ∗ which does not maximize the Levenshtein bound, one cannot ﬁnd a bound-achieving sequence set whose sequences form a weighted-correlation complementary set characterized by w ∗ .\n3) It is noted that the Welch bound cannot be improved for set size of 2 1 , because the tightest Levenshtein bound in that case is achieved by the Welch bound when the weighting vector with all equal elements is used [14]. Hence, in the context of 1), such weighted-correlation complementary set will degenerate to a Golay comple- mentary pair.\n4) In the end, if a Golay complementary pair of length- N does not exist, the Levenshtein bound for set size of 2 will be loose because the equality cannot be met. For instance, it has been shown that the binary Golay complementary pair of N < 100 doesn\u2019t exist unless N = 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 16, 20, 26, 32, 40, 52, 64, 80 [16].\nThe work of Zi Long Liu and Yong Liang Guan was supported in full by the Advanced Communications Research Program DSOCL06271, a research grant from the Directorate of Research and Technology (DRTech), Ministry of Defence, Singapore."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"L.
