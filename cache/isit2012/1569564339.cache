We consider a dual problem, inverting a ﬁxed number d modulo 2 n − 1 for all suitable n.\nLet d be a ﬁxed positive integer and n ≥ 2 such that gcd(2 n − 1, d) = 1. Then d is invertible modulo 2 n − 1 for all such n. We denote by d −1 the least positive residue of d modulo 2 n − 1. Are there any properties shared by the inverses d −1 modulo any 2 n − 1? Is it possible to ﬁnd an explicit formula for d −1 modulo 2 n − 1 for all n? In this paper we study these questions for several families of integers d: mainly for the exponents of the known APN power functions on F 2 n . We call integers deﬁning APN power function APN exponents. The inverses of APN exponents are APN as well. It is usually said that the known AP N and AB power permutations are those listed in Table I (with their shifts and inverses modulo 2 n − 1), cf. [7]. However, for a better understanding of AP N and AB exponents, it could be helpful to have explicit representations of these inverses. An important parameter for an APN exponent is its binary weight, which deﬁnes the algebraic degree of the corresponding function and thus resistance of it to some cryptological attacks. The study of inverses of APN exponents was originated in [13] and [14], where the inverses and their binary weights for the so-called Gold and Niho exponents were found respectively. In this paper we give the inverses and their binary weights for the so-called Welch and Dobbertin exponents. Herewith the Kasami exponent remains the only known APN exponent for which the inverse is not completely understood. For the Kasami exponent we have some partial results. We generalize also the work of Nyberg [13], and give results for exponents of the shape 2 k − 1. This paper is an extended abstract, more complete studies will appear in a forthcoming article.\nLet F 2 n be the ﬁnite ﬁeld of order 2 n , for basic theory on ﬁnite ﬁelds we refer to [11].\nDeﬁnition 1. (a) A function F : F 2 n → F 2 n is called AP N (almost perfect nonlinear) if for any non-zero a ∈ F 2 n and any b ∈ F 2 n the equation F (x + a) + F (x) = b has at most 2 solutions.\n(b) A function F : F 2 n → F 2 n , n odd, is called AB (almost bent) if\nThe AP N and AB functions provide the best resistance to differential and linear attacks, respectively, when used as S-boxes in cryptography. There are very few known examples of AP N and AB functions. The best studied such functions are the power functions x → x d , x ∈ F 2 n , where d is a ﬁxed integer. Power AP N and AB functions play also an important role in coding theory and in the study of reversed Dickson polynomials [8], [10].\nIt is easy to see that a power function F : F 2 n → F 2 n is bijective if and only if gcd(d, 2 n −1) = 1.The (compositional) inverse of a bijective power function F (x) = x d is given by F −1 (x) = x e where e is the inverse of d modulo 2 n − 1, i.e. ed ≡ 1 (mod 2 n − 1).\nDeﬁnition 2. Let d and n be positive integers. We denote by wt 2 (d) the Hamming weight of the binary representation of d, and by wt 2,n (d) the Hamming weight of the least positive residue of d modulo 2 n −1. The algebraic degree of the power function x → x d on F 2 n is wt 2,n (d).\nThe following theorem summarizes the properties of AP N and AB power functions, see for example [1], [7], [8].\nTheorem 1. 1) An AP N power function on F 2 n is bi- jective if n is odd, and it is 3 − to − 1 if n is even (where 3 − to − 1 means that every non-zero image has 3 preimages).\n3) The (compositional) inverse of an AP N/AB function is AP N/AB as well.\n4) An exponent d deﬁnes AP N/AB function if and only if 2 · d does so.\n5) The algebraic degree of an AB function on F 2 n does not exceed (n + 1)/2.\nRemark 1. We say that d and d are in the same cyclotomic coset modulo 2 n − 1 if\nfor some 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. When working modulo 2 n − 1, we call 2 i · d a shift of d.\nThe known AP N and AB power permutations are those listed in Table I (with their shifts and inverses modulo 2 n −1), see for example Chapter 3 of [7].\nThe integers of binary weight 2 deﬁne power functions of algebraic degree 2 on F 2 n , therefore they are often referred to as quadratic exponents. The next result is well known, a proof of it can be found, for example, in [12, Lemma 11.1].\nLemma 1. Let n and k be positive integers. Then \t n gcd(n,k) is odd if and only if gcd(2 k + 1, 2 n − 1) = 1; and \t n gcd(n,k) is even if and only if gcd(2 k + 1, 2 n − 1) = 2 gcd(n,k) + 1.\nThe quadratic AP N exponents are the Gold exponents in Table I.\nwt 2,n ((2 k + 1) −1 ) = n − s + 2 2\nSince 2 r ≡ 2 r (mod n) (mod 2 n − 1), we can consider the exponents in (2) as elements of the cyclic group Z n . Let g be the subgroup of Z n generated by g ∈ Z n . Then\nwhere the exponents of the latter sum describe the coset i+ s . Since the set of cosets of s partition Z n we get\nThe above considerations show in particular that the different summands in (1) remain distinct modulo (2 n − 1). Hence\n2 2k − 1 . As a special case of Theorem 2, we have:\nWe call integers 2 2k − 2 k + 1 with 0 < k < n Kasami exponents. In our considerations we may assume k ≤ n 2 , since 2 2k −2 k +1 and 2 2(n−k) −2 n−k +1 lie in the same cyclotomic coset modulo 2 n − 1. Indeed, (2 2(n−k) − 2 n−k + 1)2 2k ≡ 2 2k − 2 k + 1 (mod 2 n − 1).\nThe following lemma describes Kasami exponents, which are invertible modulo (2 n − 1).\nLemma 3. It holds gcd(2 2k − 2 k + 1, 2 n − 1) = 1 if and only if one of the following cases occurs:\nEquivalently, gcd(2 2k − 2 k + 1, 2 n − 1) = 1 if and only if one of the following cases occurs:\n\u2022 n = 2 r 3 u a and k = 2 s 3 v b, where b is odd, 1 ≤ s < r and 0 ≤ u ≤ v.\nNote that if \t n gcd(n,k) is odd, then 2 k + 1 and 2 3k + 1 are invertible modulo 2 n − 1. Then the observation 2 2k − 2 k + 1 = (2 3k + 1)/(2 k + 1) together with Theorem 2 implies:\nTheorem 3. Let n = t · gcd(n, k) with t odd and d = 2 2k − 2 k + 1. The least positive residue d −1 satisﬁes:\nRemark 3. It is interesting to observe that Kasami exponents d = 2 2k − 2 k + 1 with small ratio n k fulﬁll:\n\u2022 if k = n/2 then c (d) = c (2 n/2+1 − 1) \u2022 if k = n/3 then c (d −1 ) = c (2 k + 1)\nwhere c (a) = c (b) denotes that the integers a and b are in the same cyclotomic coset.\nFor n = 2t+1, integers of the shape 2 t +3 are called Welch exponents when considered modulo 2 n − 1. In contrast to the quadratic and Kasami exponents, the Welch exponent depends on n. In fact, it is proved in [9], that the only APN exponents which do not depend on n are Gold and Kasami exponents.\nOur considerations show that the main difﬁculty in ﬁnding the inverses modulo 2 n − 1 for a given integer is to guess it. After having the conjectural inverse for an integer, usually the correctness of it follows by easy direct calculations. The following lemma helps us to guess the inverse of the Welch exponent.\nLemma 4. Let n = 2t + 1. Then the inverse ω of the Welch exponent 2 t + 3 modulo 2 n − 1 is deﬁned by the following identity\nRemark 4. From Lemma 4 and Theorem 2 it follows that the inverse of the Welch exponent 2 t + 3 modulo 2 n − 1 can be calculated as\nObserve that (4) is not the least positive residue of the inverse of the Welch exponent modulo 2 n − 1, since some of its summands exceed 2 n − 1.\nThe advantage of deﬁning identity (3) of ω is that the involved numbers 17 and 2 n − 2 t+1 + 5 = 2 t+1 (2 t − 1) + 5 have binary representations with \u201ceasy\u201d combinatorics. This allows us to ﬁnd the binary representation of the least positive residue of ω (mod 2 n − 1), which will yield the explicit form and the algebraic degree of the compositional inverse of the Welch power function.\nTheorem 4. Let ω be the least positive residue of the inverse of Welch exponent modulo 2 n − 1 with n = 2t + 1.\nwith binary weight t + 1. \u2022 If t ≡ 1 (mod 8) then\nwith binary weight t + 1. \u2022 If t ≡ 2 (mod 8) then\nt−3 − 1 17\nwith binary weight t + 1. \u2022 If t ≡ 7 (mod 8) then\nt−7 − 1 17\nProof: We demonstrate the proof ideas for t ≡ 0 (mod 8). Let t = 8k, n = 16k + 1 and ω k,0 be the least\npositive residue of the inverse of Welch exponent modulo 2 n − 1. We denote by ω k,0 the binary representation of ω k,0 of length n. The main observation yielding the proof is that ω k,0 can be found recursively as follows:\nIn particular, the binary weight of ω k,0 is 8k + 1 = t + 1. By Lemma 4 it is enough to show that ω k,0 satisﬁes identity (3). Note that ω k,0 satisfy identity (3) if and only if the sum (with carry) of the sequence ω k,0 with its 4-shift is the sequence\nwhere a = 1100 and c = 0110, and ¯ a, ¯ c are their binary complements respectively. And thus the sum corresponding to (1 + 2 4 ) · ω k,0 is\na ¯ a . . . a \t ¯ a 1 \t c ¯ c c ¯ c . . . c \t ¯ c ¯ a . . . a ¯ a \t 1 c \t ¯ c c ¯ c . . . c ¯ c \t a\n111 . . . 11 11110 000 . . . 00 0101 proving the statement.\nFor completeness, we give here also results for Niho exponents obtained by Portmann and Rennhard [14]. For n = 2t + 1, integers d of the shape\nare called Niho exponents. The inverses for Niho exponents depend on n (mod 8). Observe, that in the case n ≡ 1 (mod 4), that is n = 4a + 1, the Niho exponent is d = 2 2a + 2 a − 1. In the case n ≡ 3 (mod 4), that is n = 4a + 3, the Niho exponent is given by 2 3a+2 + 2 2a+1 − 1.\nWe call the integer 2 4k + 2 3k + 2 2k + 2 k − 1 = 2 5k −1 2 k −1 − 2 considered modulo 2 n − 1 with n = 5k Dobbertin\u2019s exponent.\nTheorem 6. Let k ≥ 1 be an odd integer and n = 5k. Then the least positive residue of the inverse of d = 2 4k + 2 3k + 2 2k + 2 k − 1 modulo 2 n − 1 is\nd −1 = 1 2\n2 5k − 1 2 k − 1\nk+1 − 1 3\nand direct calculations using the above identity show that 2d −1 · d ≡ 2 (mod 2 n − 1).\nNot much is known about the possible algebraic degrees of APN functions. By Theorem 6 the inverse of Dobbertin exponent deﬁnes an APN function on F 2 n with algebraic degree exceeding (n + 1)/2 for n odd. The only previously known such example was the inverse function, with algebraic degree n − 1. This observation with Theorem 1 (5) shows that the functions deﬁned by Dobbertin exponent and their inverses are not AB, which was originally shown in [5] by exploiting the divisibility properties of corresponding codes.\nCorollary 2. Power functions with Dobbertin exponents and their inverses are not AB.\nIn [3] it is shown that the exponents 2 k − 1 have interesting properties for cryptological applications. Here we give the inverse of these exponents:\nThe classical modular inversion is the problem to invert numbers modulo a ﬁxed number. We consider a dual problem, inverting a ﬁxed number d modulo 2 n − 1 for all suitable n. In this paper we found explicitly the inverses for Welch and Dobbertin exponents. A future project is a systematic study of this problem for other ﬁxed integers d.\nThe authors would like to thank Pascale Charpin for number of comments and suggestions, which improved this manuscript.
