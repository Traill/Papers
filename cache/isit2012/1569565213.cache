Namely, we provide a single letter characterization for the capacity region when the encoders have access to non-causal asymmetric partial CSI and the decoder has complete CSI. When the encoders observe asymmetric noisy CSI with asymmetric delays and the decoder observes complete CSI, we provide a single letter characterization for the capacity region. Finally, we consider a cooperative scenario with common and private messages, with noisy CSIT and complete CSIR and provide a single letter expression for the capacity region. For the cooperative scenario, we also note that as soon as the common message encoder does not have access to CSI, then for any noisy CSIT and CSIR setup it is possible to obtain a single letter characterization for the capacity region."},"body":{"text":"Channels which are controlled by a state process have been widely studied for both single and multi-user channels. For single-user channels, Shannon [2] provides the capacity formula with causal noiseless CSIT, where the state process is i.i.d., and [3] extends Shannon\u2019s result to the noisy CSIT and the noisy CSIR case, which is later shown to be a special case of Shannon\u2019s model [4].\nThe literature on FS-MAC with different assumptions of CSIT and CSIR is extensive and the main contributions of the current paper have several interactions with the results in the literature, which we present in Subsection I-A. Hence, we discuss the relevant literature for the multi-user setting in more detail. To start, [5] provides a multi-letter characterization of the capacity region of time-varying MACs with general channel statistics (with/without memory) under a general state process (not necessarily stationary or ergodic) and with various degrees of CSIT and CSIR. In [6], a general framework for the capacity region of MACs with causal and non-causal CSI is presented. In particular, an achievable rate region is presented for the memoryless FS-MAC with correlated CSI and the sum- rate capacity is established under the condition that the state information available to each encoder are independent. This result is extended to a correlated setup in [7]. In [8], MACs with complete CSIR and noncausal, partial, rate limited CSITs\nare considered. In particular, for the degraded case, a single letter formula for the capacity region is provided and when the CSITs are not degraded, inner and outer bounds are derived, see [8, Theorems 1, 2]. Another active research direction on the FS-MAC regards the so-called cooperative FS-MAC where there exists a degraded condition on the message sets. In particular, [9] and [10] characterize the capacity region of the cooperative FS-MAC with states non-causally and causally available at the transmitters. For more recent results on the FS-MAC problem see [11]-[14].\nWe consider several scenarios where the encoders and the decoder observe various degrees of asymmetric (noisy or par- tial) CSI. For the noisy CSI, the essential requirement we im- pose is that the noisy CSI available to the encoders is realized via the corruption of CSI by different noise processes, which give a realistic physical structure of the communication setup. We herein note that the asymmetric noisy CSI assumption is plausible as typically the feedback links are imperfect and sufﬁciently far from each other so that the information carried through them is corrupted by different (independent) noise processes. What makes (asymmetric) noisy setups particularly interesting are the facts that\n(a) No transmitter\u2019s CSI contains the CSI at the other one; (b) CSIR does not contain any of the CSITs;\nand when existing results, which give a single letter capacity formulation, are examined, it can be seen that most of them do not satisfy (a) or (b) or both (e.g., [1], [5], [6], [8], [12]).\nWith this motivation, we treat the scenarios below and pro- vide single letter characterizations for their capacity regions:\n(1) The FS-MAC with asymmetric non-causal partial CSITs and complete CSIR (Theorem 1).\n(2) The FS-MAC with asymmetrically delayed and asymmet- ric noisy CSITs and CSIR (Theorem 2).\n(3) The cooperative FS-MAC in which both encoders trans- mit a common message and one transmitter (informed transmitter) transmits an additional private message. The informed encoder has causal noisy CSI, the other encoder has a delayed noisy CSI and the receiver has various degrees of CSI (Theorems 3 and 4).\nThe solution that we provide to (1) solves [8, Theorem 2] without rate constraints on the coded side information and\nextends [6, Theorem 5] to the case where the encoders have correlated CSI. Furthermore, since the causal and non-causal capacities are identical for scenario (1), it can be considered as an extension of [4, Proposition 1] to a noisy multi-user case. Finally, (3) is an extension of [9, Theorem 4] to a noisy setup.\nThe main component in this paper is a generalization of the converse coding approach recently introduced in [1] and herein considerably extended and adapted for the noisy CSI setup. The converse coding approach of [1] is based on using memoryless stationary team policies which play a key role in showing that the past information is irrelevant. This is obtained by showing that under any policy that one can achieve using an arbitrary decentralized coding policy, the same performance can be achieved by using memoryless stationary team policies. However, as the authors mention in [1, Remark 2], the arguments in their paper hold if the state information available at the decoder contains the one available at the two transmitters. In this way, the decoder does not need to estimate the coding policies used under decentralized time- sharing.\nFor the noisy setup, we need to modify this approach to account for the fact that the decoder does not have access to the CSITs, and that the past state information does not lead to a tractable recursion.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we present notation and preliminaries, in Sections III, IV and V, we formally state scenarios (1), (2) and (3), respectively, and present the main results and several observations. In Section VI, we present concluding remarks. The proofs of all our results are available in detail in [15].\nThroughout the paper, a random variable will be denoted by an upper case letter X and its particular realization by a lower case letter x. For a vector v, and a positive integer i, v i will denote the i-th entry of v, while v [i] = (v 1 , · · · , v i ) and v [i,j] = (v i , · · · , v j ), i ≤ j. For a ﬁnite set A, P(A) will denote the simplex of probability distributions over A. Probability distributions are denoted by P (·) and subscripted by the name of the random variables and conditioning, e.g., P U,T |V,S (u, t|v, s) is the conditional probability of (U = u, T = t) given (V = v, S = s). All sets considered hereafter are ﬁnite.\nWe consider a two-user memoryless FS-MAC, with two encoders, a, b, and two independent message sources W a and W b which are uniformly distributed in the sets W a ∈ {1, 2, · · · , |W a |} and W b ∈ {1, 2, · · · , |W b |}, respectively. The channel inputs of the encoders are X a ∈ X a and X b ∈ X b , respectively. The channel state process is modeled as a sequence {S t } ∞ t=1 of i.i.d. random variables in some space S. Let the CSI at the two encoders be modeled by S a t ∈ S a , S b t ∈ S b , respectively, for t ≥ 1. Depending on the scenario, S i t , i = {a, b}, shall denote either the partial or the\nnoisy CSITs, which we will explicitly mention in each section. The asymmetric partial CSITs are obtained via deterministic mappings; S a t = β a (S t ) and S b t = β b (S t ), where β i : S → S i , i = {a, b}, can be considered as quantizers.\nWhen the CSITs are asymmetric noisy versions of S t , we assume that the joint distribution of (S t , S a t , S b t ) factorizes as\nand that {(S t , S a t , S b t )} ∞ t=1 is a sequence of i.i.d. triples and independent from (W a , W b );\nLet W := (W a , W b ) and X := (X a , X b ). The channel is memoryless and hence,\nWhen CSITs are causal, we shall use Shannon strategies [2]: Let the set of all possible functions from S a to X a and S b to X b be denoted by T a := X a S a and T b := X b S b , respectively. We refer to T a -valued and T b -valued random vectors as Shannon strategies.\nWe next introduce memoryless stationary team policies [1] which will be invoked in the main results of this paper.\nDeﬁnition 1: A memoryless stationary (in time) team pol- icy is a family of one of\nFinally, for a region R(α), co α∈Λ R(α) denotes the closure of the convex hull of the regions R(α) associated to all possible α ∈ Λ.\nWe now present the main results. Note that the ﬁrst section considers the case where the encoders observe asymmetric, partial CSI non-causally. In the other sections, CSITs are noisy versions of S t .\nLet S a t = β a (S t ) and S b t = β b (S t ) and assume also that S t is fully available at the receiver; see Fig. 1. The channel inputs at time t are, i.e. X a t and X b t , are functions of the locally available information (W a , S a [n] ) and (W b , S b [n] ), respectively.\n- -\nDeﬁnition 2: An (n, 2 nR a , 2 nR b ) code with block length n and rates (R a , R b ) for an FS-MAC with partial state feedback consists of\nA rate pair (R a , R b ) is achievable if for any > 0 there exists, for all n sufﬁciently large, an (n, 2 nR a , 2 nR b ) code such that\nlog |W a | ≥ R a ≥ 0, 1 n log |W b | ≥ R b ≥ 0 and P (n) e ≤ .

For the converse proof see [15, Appendix A]. The proof for the non-causal case is realized by observing that there is no loss of optimality if not only the past, as shown in [1], but also the future CSI is ignored given that the receiver is provided with complete CSI.\nRemark 1: Following [1, Remark 1], it is worth to empha- size that for the above argument to work, it is crucial that CSIR contains the CSITs. In particular, this fact plays a role in the converse part of the coding theorem by enabling the decoder to ignore the past channel outputs, without any loss of optimality.\nLet us consider the scenario considered in [7] where the two encoders observe causal asymmetric noisy version of CSI, S a t , S b t , respectively, whose joint distribution satisfy (1) and the decoder has complete CSI. Although the full capacity region is not known, it is shown in [7] that the sum rate capacity is given by sup π T a (t a )π\nI(T a , T b ; Y |S). Obviously, the CSIR does not contain the CSITs. We now demonstrate that if the encoders in this setup observe noisy CSI non-causally, then it is not guaranteed that the Shannon strategies are optimal, for the sum-rate capacity. The reason for this is that Remark 1 is violated.\nFor the converse, using Fano\u2019s inequality and standard steps we get R a +R b ≤ 1 n I(W; Y [n] , S [n] )+ n , where lim →0 n = 0. Let us now consider the term I(W; Y [n] , S [n] ). We have\nwhere T t := (T a t , T b t ). Observe now that, given the full CSI and Shannon strategies, the past channel output information is not useless in the non-causal setup. This is because, we have\nwhere the equality is veriﬁed by (3), and therefore, the past channel outputs can not be ignored, which was one of the main reasons of optimality of Shannon strategies in the causal noisy setup.\nLet the two encoders have accesses to asymmetrically delayed, where delays are d a ≥ 1 and d b ≥ 1, respectively, and noisy versions of the state information S t at each time t ≥ 1, S a t−d a ∈ S a , S b t−d b ∈ S b , respectively. Hence, the model satisﬁes (1), (2) and (3). We also assume that S t is fully available at the receiver. A code can be deﬁned as in Deﬁnition 2, except now\nLet C DN denotes the capacity region of the delayed setup.

See [15, Appendix B] for the proofs.\nRemark 2 (Strictly Causal Case): When d a = d b = 1, Theorem 2 is the capacity region of the setup with strictly causal noisy CSITs. In [11], achievable rate region is provided for the case when the channel is driven by two independent states (with no CSIR). When the encoders have strictly causal CSI (not noisy/not asymmetric), the authors proposed a region which is based on sending a compressed version of the CSITs to the decoder. Theorem 2 veriﬁes that since the full CSI is available at the receiver there exists no loss of optimality if the past information at the encoders is ignored.\nFinally, for an asymmetric delayed CSIT setup of an FS-MAC with Markovian state process see [12].\nAssume a common message is provided to both encoders and one of the encoders has its own private message. Assume further that the encoder with the private message causally observes noisy state information, whereas the encoder with the common message only observes noisy state information with delay d a ≥ 1. Let the common and the private messages be W a and W b , respectively, and S a [t−d\n, d a ≥ 1, and S b [t] denote the noisy CSI at encoder a, b, respectively, where (S t , S a t , S b t ) satisﬁes (1) and (2). Hence, X a t = φ (a) t (W a , S a [t−d\n) and X b t = φ (b) t (W a , W b , S b [t] ); see Fig. 2. Let C C denote the capacity region for this channel.

See [15, Appendix C] for the proof.\nOne important observation to be made in the cooperative scenario is that we do not require a product form on the pair (X a , T b ) (see (19)). In connection with this observation, let us consider the following noisy CSIR setup.\nLet the encoder with the private message causally observe noisy CSI, whereas the encoder with the common message has no CSI, i.e., X a t = φ (a) t (W a ) and X b t = φ (b) t (W a , W b , S b [t] ), and the decoder also has access to noisy CSI at time t, S r t ∈ S r ; see Fig. 3. Let C G C denote the capacity region for this setup.

Furthermore, the result also holds with no CSIR, i.e., S r = ∅ is allowed, and in this case Theorem 4 is as an extension of [9, Theorem 4] to a noisy setup.\nNote that for the setup given in [9, Theorem 4], The- orem 4 provides an equivalent characterization. Recall that in [9, Theorem 4] the informed encoder has full CSI, i.e., X b t = φ (b) t (W a , W b , S [t] ), both the uniformed encoder and the decoder has no CSI and the capacity region, C AS , is given as the closure of all rate pairs (R a , R b ) satisfying\nR b < I(U ; Y |X a ) \t (23) R b + R a < I(U, X a ; Y ) \t (24)\nfor some joint measure on S × X a × X b × Y × U having the form\nwhere |U | ≤ |S||X a ||X b |+1. On the other hand, for this setup, Theorem 4 gives the capacity region, C G F S , as co \t ˆ π R C (ˆ π)\nwhere R C (ˆ π) denotes the region of all rate pairs R = (R a , R b ) satisfying\nR b < I(T ; Y |X a ) \t (26) R a + R b < I(T, X a ; Y ) \t (27)\nFor the proof of C G F S = C AS , see [15, Appendix D]. Note that for this multi-user setup, the relation between the auxiliary variable and Shannon strategies requires more attention; in particular, note the difference between |U | and |T |.\nRemark 4: For the validity of Theorem 4 it is crucial that X a t only depends on W a . To be more explicit, let us assume S r = ∅ and consider the following steps of the converse\nSince S t is not available to the decoder, the above equality is valid if and only if X a [n] does not provide any information about S t . Hence, whether CSITs are noisy or not, if there is no CSI or noisy CSI at the decoder, the arguments above would fail if the uninformed encoder observes some degree of\nCSI, i.e., d a < ∞ so that X a [n] carry some information about (S t , S b t , S r t ).\nWe have considered several scenarios for the memoryless FS-MAC with various degrees of asymmetric (noisy and partial) CSIT and complete and noisy CSIR. We obtain single letter characterizations for the capacity regions when the en- coders observe non-causal, partial asymmetric CSI and when the CSITs are asymmetric noisy and asymmetrically delayed. We further discuss a cooperative scenario and show that when the common message encoder does not have an access to the current noisy CSI, due to delay, it is possible to obtain a single letter expression for the capacity region. Since a product form is not required in a cooperative scenario, we observed that as soon as the common message encoder does not have access to CSI, then in any noisy setup, covering the cases where no CSIR or noisy CSIR, it is possible to obtain a single letter expression for the capacity region."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"G.
