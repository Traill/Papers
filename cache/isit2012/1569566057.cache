If f is bandlimited, the classical sampling theorem of Petersen and Middleton [1] provide schemes for sampling and reconstructing the ﬁeld from its values measured on a lattice in R d . Various results on more general sampling conﬁgurations are also known (see, e.g., [2] [3] for a summary). One example of such a sampling conﬁguration is a union of shifted lattices. Sampling on such sets arises naturally in a number of applications in signal processing and remote sensing [4], in interlaced sampling schemes in tomography [5], in recovery of functions from their local averages [6], and also in spatial sampling using mobile sensors [7] . Such a conﬁguration is easy to analyze [8] when the points lie on a union of shifted versions of the same lattice. Recently more general results on sampling on a union of shifted lattices have been obtained in an abstract harmonic analysis framework [9] but, to the best of our knowledge, there are no works that study the general problem in the classical signal processing context.\nIn this paper, we study the problem of sampling on a union of shifted lattices, under certain assumptions on the lat- tices. We describe practical spatial sampling scenarios where these assumptions are satisﬁed. Under these assumptions, we identify simple necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for perfect reconstruction of bandlimited ﬁelds. We also provide an explicit reconstruction scheme for perfectly recovering the bandlimited ﬁeld from the measurements taken at the sampling points. Our solution is easier to understand and implement than the more general result on sampling on a union of lattices in the abstract harmonic analysis literature.\nFor vectors x, y ∈ R d we use x, y to denote the inner- product in Euclidean space. For any set Ω ⊂ R d and r ∈ R d\nwe use ◦ Ω to denote the interior of Ω in Euclidean space, χ Ω (.) to denote the characteristic function of Ω, and Ω(r) to denote a translated version of Ω, deﬁned as:\nWe begin by providing background on related problems in Section II. In Section III we discuss the problem of sampling on unions of shifted lattices and present our results and examples. We conclude in Section IV.\nWe denote a ﬁeld in d-dimensional space by a complex- valued mapping f : R d → C. For a ﬁeld f (.), we deﬁne its Fourier transform F (.) as\nwhere i denotes the imaginary unit, and u, v denotes the scalar product between vectors u and v in R d . We use B Ω to denote the collection of ﬁelds with ﬁnite energy such that the Fourier transform F of f is supported on a set Ω ⊂ R d , i.e.,\nA bandlimited ﬁeld has the advantage that it is possible to represent the ﬁeld using only the samples of the ﬁeld measured at a discrete collection of points. We say that a collection of points Λ forms a sampling set for Ω if any ﬁeld f ∈ B Ω can be uniquely reconstructed using only its values on the points in Λ. We use S Ω to denote the collection of all sampling sets for Ω. We now discuss known results on conditions for sampling and reconstruction of bandlimited ﬁelds.\nThe most well-known result on sampling of bandlimited ﬁelds deals with sampling on a lattice. A lattice Λ in R d is deﬁned as a collection of points of the form\nwhere {v i : 1 ≤ i ≤ d} forms a basis for R d . We say that the lattice Λ is generated by the vectors {v i : 1 ≤ i ≤ d}. The necessary and sufﬁcient conditions on Λ for reconstructing\na ﬁeld f in B Ω using the samples of the ﬁeld taken on Λ follow from the results of [1]. Let {u i : 1 ≤ i ≤ d} denote a reciprocal set of lattice vectors in R d satisfying\nu i , v j = 2πδ ij . Then the associated sampled ﬁeld spectrum is composed of spectral repetitions of f and is supported on\nin the Fourier domain we say that the samples are aliased and in this case it is not possible to perfectly reconstruct the ﬁeld from its samples. The repetitions do not overlap provided\nThis is the condition required to ensure that any ﬁeld f ∈ B Ω can be reconstructed based on samples on the lattice Λ. For example if a ﬁeld in R 2 is bandlimited to a set Ω in the form of a circular disc of radius ρ, then it can be reconstructed exactly by sampling on a rectangular lattice with v 1 = (X, 0) and v 2 = (0, Y ), provided X < π ρ and Y < π ρ .\nA shift of a lattice Λ is a set of the form Λ + w : {x + w : x ∈ Λ} where w is a vector representing the shift. A union of such shifted versions of the same lattice Λ gives a more general conﬁguration of sampling points, e.g., N k=1 (Λ + w k ) where w k ∈ R d are the shifts. Such a conﬁguration of sampling points is also known by other names such as periodic sampling or bunched sampling. Various au- thors have studied such sampling conﬁgurations and identiﬁed schemes for perfect reconstruction from samples taken on such a conﬁguration of points (see, e.g., [5] and references therein). One approach for studying such sampling problems is to view this as a special case of Papoulis\u2019 generalized sampling [10] in higher dimensions. Since a shift in the spatial domain can be interpreted as a ﬁltering operation, the samples obtained from each individual lattice in the union can be viewed as samples of a ﬁltered version of the ﬁeld taken at points on the original lattice Λ. Thus this problem can be interpreted as a multichannel sampling problem and solved using Papoulis\u2019 approach [10] as outlined in [8].\nA more general sampling conﬁguration is a union of shifted versions of lattices that are not necessarily identical. In the following section, we consider this setting in detail. We describe known results and then present new results.\nwhere for each k, the vectors {v k j : 1 ≤ j ≤ d} forms a basis for R d . For each k let {u k j : 1 ≤ j ≤ d} denote a reciprocal set of lattice vectors deﬁned by the relation\nWe now study the problem of sampling bandlimited ﬁelds f ∈ B Ω on the union of shifted versions of these lattices given by\nwhere w k ∈ R d represent the shifts. This problem has been studied by various authors in one dimension [11] and higher dimensions [9], [12]. However, in higher dimensions, the conditions and algorithms for perfect reconstruction in [9] are stated for locally compact abelian groups under an abstract harmonic analysis framework. In this section, we show that under certain conditions on the shifted lattices, this problem admits a simple and explicit solution.\nAs we saw in Section II-A, the spectrum of the sampled ﬁeld obtained by samples taken on each individual lattice Λ k is composed of spectral repetitions in d directions. We also saw that if the repetitions in the sampled spectrum on a lattice do not overlap, then the original ﬁeld can be reconstructed exactly from the samples on this lattice. The same reasoning holds for sampling on a shifted lattice since a spatial shift of the ﬁeld f ∈ B Ω does not change the support of its Fourier transform. However, while sampling a ﬁeld f ∈ B Ω on a union of shifted lattices U , it may be possible to perfectly reconstruct the ﬁeld f based on all the samples even if the samples on each individual shifted lattice are aliased (e.g., see Example 3.2 later in the paper). In this section we present some conditions and schemes for perfect recovery. Let Q ⊂ R d be deﬁned as\nThe following proposition gives a simple necessary condition on U and Ω for perfect reconstruction.\nProposition 3.1: Let Ω ⊂ R d be a compact set and let U denote a union of shifted lattices of the form (2). Suppose Q ⊂ ◦ Ω(s) for some s ∈ R d . Then U / ∈ S Ω .\nIt is easily veriﬁed that the ﬁeld f ǫ vanishes at all points on U . Hence f ǫ cannot be distinguished from the function that is identically zero using the ﬁeld samples on U . Moreover, for ǫ small enough, the ﬁeld f ǫ has a Fourier transform supported within a subset of Ω. Thus U / ∈ S Ω .\nUnder certain assumptions the simple necessary conditions stated above are also sufﬁcient to ensure that U ∈ S Ω . We require the following assumptions on U and Ω:\n(A2) For each k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N } the vectors {v k j : j ≥ 2} are small enough so that the following condition holds\nwhere ˜ Z d := {m ∈ Z d : m j = 0 for some j ≥ 2}.\nThe assumption (A2) is equivalent to saying that each lattice Λ k is ﬁnely sampled along the directions {v k j : j ≥ 2} so that the overlaps in the corresponding sampled spectrum, if any, arise due to repetitions in the direction u k 1 . Hence under assumption (A2) the spectrum from each shifted lattice Λ k + w k is aliased at most in one direction - the direction of u k 1 .\nAssumption (A1) is often satisﬁed in practical applications of sampling low-pass phenomena. We now discuss practical sampling scenarios where the assumption (A2) is satisﬁed. Suppose that the process of sampling the ﬁeld is accomplished by measuring the ﬁeld values along hyperplanes at ﬁne res- olutions. For a ﬁeld in R 2 , this means that the measurement procedure involves scanning the ﬁeld along straight lines at high resolutions. Such a scenario is well motivated in spatial sampling using mobile sensors [7]. A mobile sensor moving along a straight line can sample the ﬁeld at high resolutions along its path without incurring any additional cost in terms of distance traveled. Now consider a measurement setup in which the measurements are taken by sensors moving along a sequence of equispaced parallel lines. We refer to such a sequence of equispaced parallel lines as a uniform set of lines, like in [7]. If the samples taken on the various lines are themselves aligned then the collection of all such samples lies on a shifted lattice in R 2 . If we have a collection of several such uniform sets, then the collection of all samples lie on a union of shifted lattices in R 2 . Furthermore, since the measurements are taken at a ﬁne resolution along the lines assumption (A2) is satisﬁed. An example of such a sampling conﬁguration is shown in Figure 1(a). Similarly, one could consider a scheme for measuring ﬁelds in R 3 on several uniform sets of planes. If the samples from the planes on a uniform set are aligned, then they form a shifted lattice in R 3 . The collection of all samples from several such uniform sets lie on a union of shifted lattices in R 3 and since the measurements are taken at a ﬁne resolution along the planes, it follows that assumption (A2) is satisﬁed.\nMotivated by the practical examples provided above, we show that, under assumptions (A1) and (A2), the necessary conditions from Proposition 3.1 are also sufﬁcient for perfectly reconstructing bandlimited ﬁelds in B Ω from their measure- ments on U . We have the following theorem.\nTheorem 3.2: Let U be a union of shifted lattices in R d deﬁned in (2), and Ω ⊂ R d satisfy 1 Assumptions (A1) and (A2). Suppose that the vectors {u 1 1 , u 2 1 , . . . , u N 1 } are\nSketch of proof: The result of (4) follows from Proposi- tion 3.1. The sufﬁcient condition of (3) is proved by demon- strating an explicit reconstruction strategy. This follows by the same steps as used to prove [7, Thm 4.3]. The proof is long and hence omitted. We refer the reader to [7] for details.\nNow that we have identiﬁed the conditions for perfect re- construction, we now seek explicit reconstruction schemes for reconstructing the bandlimited ﬁelds assuming that the sufﬁcient condition of (3) holds. The reconstruction scheme can be obtained by studying the spectra of the sampled ﬁelds. In the sequel we use the following abusive notation for n ∈ Z d . We use n, v k to denote d ℓ=1 n ℓ v k ℓ and n, u k to denote\nn ℓ u k ℓ . Let f k s denote the sampled impulse stream from the kth shifted lattice Λ k + w k deﬁned as\nwhere δ(.) represents the Dirac-delta function in d-dimensions. It follows from [1] that the Fourier transform of this sampled impulse stream is given by\nUnder assumption (A2) this spectrum satisﬁes F k s (ω) =\nIn the following proposition we provide the structure of the reconstruction scheme. To maintain continuity the proof is relegated to the appendix.\nProposition 3.3: Let f ∈ B Ω denote a bandlimited ﬁeld. Under the conditions of Theorem 3.2, there exists a partition of Ω into mutually disjoint sets Ω ℓ , ℓ = 1, 2, . . . , L, integers 1 ≤ m ℓ < ∞, and scalars β i,k,n for i ∈ {1, . . . , L}, j ∈ {1, . . . , m i }, k ∈ {1, . . . , N }, n ∈ Z d such that\nwhere ˆ χ Ω i (.) represents the inverse Fourier transform of the characteristic function of Ω i . \t ⊓ ⊔ Thus the interpolation formula of (7) can be used to reconstruct the bandlimited ﬁeld f ∈ B Ω using only its samples. The exact values of β i,k,n and Ω i depends on the speciﬁc problem at hand. Thus (7) represents the interpolation formula for reconstructing the ﬁeld f from its measurements on a union of shifted lattices U under assumptions (A1) and (A2). We now discuss some examples where we can explicitly evaluate the values of β i,k,n and Ω i .\nSuppose Ω is a circular disc of radius ρ centered at the origin, corresponding to an isotropic bandlimited ﬁelds. And suppose U is a union of shifted lattices as in (2) where Λ 1 and Λ 2 are both rectangular lattices with basis vectors\nv 1 1 = (0, ∆), v 1 2 = (ǫ, 0), v 2 1 = (∆, 0), v 2 2 = (0, ǫ). (8) Assume that the lattices are not shifted so that w 1 = w 2 = 0. The sampling conﬁguration U is illustrated in Figure 1(a) where Λ 1 is shown in black and Λ 2 in red. If ǫ < π ρ then Assumption (A2) holds. Suppose that this condition holds. From Theorem 3.2, it follows that perfect reconstruction is possible (i.e. U ∈ S Ω ) whenever ∆ < ∆ ∗ := √ 2π ρ . Under this condition the sampled spectra from the two lattices are as depicted in Figure 1(b). We have shown only the supports of the spectral repetitions that intersect with the main lobe. Based on the sampled spectra, we can partition Ω into ﬁve distinct regions as shown in Figure 1(c). Here Ω 1 represents the portion of Ω that is not aliased in either sampled spectrum, Ω 2 and Ω 3 represent the portions that are aliased only in the sampled spectrum from the ﬁrst lattice and Ω 4 and Ω 5 are the portions aliased only in the sampled spectrum from the second lattice. Hence the sampled spectra satisfy\nF 1 s (ω) = F (ω), \t ω ∈ Ω 1 ∪ Ω 4 ∪ Ω 5 F 2 s (ω) = F (ω), \t ω ∈ Ω 2 ∪ Ω 3 .\nThus F (.) can be recovered from the sampled spectra as F (ω)\nTaking inverse Fourier transforms we have f (r) =\nwhich is the interpolation formula for perfectly reconstructing the ﬁeld from the samples on the two lattices. This is the equivalent of (7) for the current example. \t ⊓ ⊔ In the above example every part of Ω was unaliased in at least one of the sampled spectra and thus reconstruction was straightforward. However, in some cases it is possible to reconstruct the ﬁeld exactly even when this condition does not hold, as we illustrate in the following example.\nExample 3.2 (Rectangular lattices and non-isotropic ﬁeld): Suppose Ω := {ω ∈ R 2 : ω y ≥ 0, |ω x | + |ω y | ≤ ρ} is a triangular region. As before let U be a union of two rectangular lattices Λ 1 and Λ 2 with basis vectors given by\nSuppose ǫ < π ρ which ensures that Assumption (A2) holds. From Theorem 3.2, it follows that perfect reconstruction is possible (i.e. U ∈ S Ω ) whenever ∆ < ∆ ∗ := 2π ρ . Under this condition, the partitions of Ω are as shown in Figure 2. We see that unlike in the previous example now there are some portions of Ω that are aliased in both the sampled spectra. Now the sampled spectra satisfy the following relations:\nF 1 s (ω) = F (ω), ω ∈ Ω 1 ∪ Ω 2 ∪ Ω 3 F 2 s (ω) = F (ω), ω ∈ Ω 4 ∪ Ω 5\nand the original ﬁeld can be recovered by inverting the Fourier spectrum as in the previous example. \t ⊓ ⊔\nWe have studied the problem of sampling and reconstructing bandlimited ﬁelds on a union of shifted lattices under assump- tions (A1) and (A2). These assumptions are well justiﬁed in some practical problems of interest such as the sampling of spatial ﬁelds using mobile sensors. Under these assumptions we provide simple conditions for perfect reconstruction that are easier to verify than those provided in known results [9] on the general problem of sampling on a union of shifted lattices. We also provide explicit reconstruction schemes that are easier to implement than the known iterative reconstruction schemes for the general problem.\nThis research was supported by ERC Advanced Investiga- tors Grant: Sparse Sampling: Theory, Algorithms and Appli- cations SPARSAM no 247006.\nProof of Proposition 3.3: \t For ω ∈ Ω let {x 1 (ω), x 2 (ω), . . . , x m ω (ω)} be all the elements x ∈ Z N for which ω ∈ Ω( N k=1 x k u k 1 ). Without loss of generality, we assume x 1 (ω) to be 0. Let\nor equivalently, I(ω) = {x 1 (ω), x 2 (ω), . . . , x m ω (ω)}. Also let W (ω) := {ω − N k=1 x k u k 1 : x ∈ I(ω)}. Grouping together\nthe ω ∈ Ω for which the set I(ω) coincide yields a partition of Ω into mutually disjoint subsets Ω ℓ , ℓ = 1, 2, . . . , L. Stated formally the decomposition reads: Ω = ∪ L ℓ=1 Ω ℓ with\nFrom (6) along with the deﬁnitions above, it follows that for any ω ∈ Ω, the sampled spectra F k s (ζ) : ζ ∈ W (ω), k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N } measured on W (ω) can be expressed as linear combinations of the original spectrum F (ζ) : ζ ∈ W (ω) measured on W (ω). Clearly, for any set Ω i the structure of these equations are identical for all ω ∈ Ω i . Further- more, by Theorem 3.2 it follows that these equations can be solved to obtain the value of the original spectrum F (ω) at ω as a linear combination of F k s (ζ) : ζ ∈ W (ω), k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N }. Thus it follows that there exists scalars ˜ β i,j,k : i, j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , L}, k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N } such that for all i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , L} we have\nTaking inverse transform we get (7) where ˆ χ Ω i (.) represents the inverse Fourier transform of χ Ω i (.), and"},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"D.
