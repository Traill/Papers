The simplifying assumption that such links are useless is often made, mainly because most wireless protocols use per-hop acknowledgments. However, two-way communication between a pair of nodes can be established as soon as there exists paths in both directions between them. Therefore, instead of discarding unidirectional links, one might be interested in studying the strongly connected components of the connectivity graph.\nIn this paper, we look at the percolation phenomenon in some directed random geometric graphs that can be used to model wireless networks. We show that among the nodes that can be reached from the origin, a non-zero fraction can also reach the origin. In other words, the percolation threshold for strong connectivity is equal to the threshold for one-way connectivity."},"body":{"text":"Continuum percolation models have become popular for the modelization of the connectivity of wireless multi-hop networks. The ﬁrst such model, introduced by Gilbert [1], is quite simple and is based on the assumption that the nodes of the network have a ﬁxed transmission range. More elaborated models have been developed to capture more speciﬁc aspects of wireless networks, such as fading or interference. It turns out that in these models, unlike in Gilbert\u2019s model, one can ﬁnd pairs of nodes such that the ﬁrst can reliably transmit data to the second, but not the other way around; we call these uni- directional links . Such a situation is problematic if the protocol used in the network prescribes per-hop acknowledgments, like it is that case for instance in IEEE 802.11: according to such protocols, the receiving node must immediately acknowledge the reception of the data packet to the sender, which it cannot do if the link is unidirectional. Therefore, unidirectional links have most often been ignored and the study of the connectivity of wireless multi-hop networks restricted to the set of bi- directional links.\nHowever, two nodes can be networked as soon as there exist a forward and a backward route between them, even if these routes are distinct. In other words, they only need to belong to the same strongly connected component of the connectivity graph. In this paper, we study the emergence of a giant strongly connected component in directed random geometric graphs. We introduce two generalizations of popular undirected models for wireless multi-hop networks. Our main ﬁnding is that as soon as the out-component of the origin (the set of the nodes to which there is a directed path from the origin) is inﬁnite with positive probability, there exists a unique inﬁnite strongly connected component in the network.\nIn most models, the critical density at which this happens is well below the density required to percolate the network without using unidirectional links. Thus, our result shows that there is a measurable gain in using unidirectional links.\nSurprisingly little attention have been paid to the connec- tivity of directed random geometric graphs, although some directed models have been addressed in previous works. A popular model that generates a directed connectivity graph is the k-nearest neighbor model. A percolation phenomenon has been shown in this model for the ﬁrst time in [2]. However, in this paper, only its undirected version is studied. In [3], Balister and Bollob´as consider its directed version and compute a lower bound on the \u201cweak\u201d percolation threshold as well as an upper bound on the strong percolation threshold. However, they do not attempt to show equalities between the thresholds. In [4], Sarkar and Haenggi use a similar approach to derive bounds on the percolation thresholds of the so-called secrecy graph , originally introduced in [5]. The SINR-based connectivity model, originally presented in [6], also gener- ates a directed graph. However, a percolation phenomenon was only shown for the case where unidirectional links are discarded.\nFinally, we note that an entire ﬁeld of percolation theory, called oriented percolation (or directed percolation) is devoted to the study of connectivity in oriented lattices (see [7] for a survey). In these models, however, strong connectivity is not possible.\nThe directed random geometric graph models considered in this paper are extensions of popular and well studied undirected graph models. In these models, the vertices of the graph are assimilated to the points of an underlying (random) point process in IR d . In this work, we only consider models where the point process is a Poisson point process, denoted by X, of intensity λ. Then, each model prescribes different probabilities for the existence of edges (respectively arcs) between these points.\nIn the original Boolean model (also known as \u201cblob model\u201d or \u201cgerm grain model\u201d, abbreviated hereafter BM), each point of X is the center of a closed ball of random radius. The radii of the balls are independent of each other and identically\ndistributed. The (undirected) connectivity graph is obtained by adding an edge between all pairs of points whose balls overlap, i.e. S (x) ∩ S(y) = ∅ where S(x), S(y) denote the balls centered on x, y respectively.\nIn order to obtain a directed model, we slightly change the above rule and put an arc (i.e. a directed edge) between x and\ny if y ∈ S(x) and an arc between y and x if x ∈ S(y). We call this new model the Directed Boolean Model (DBM). It can be used, for instance, to model a wireless network where nodes do not all have the same transmit power.\nThe standard Poisson random-connection model (abbrevi- ated hereafter RCM) is obtained from as follows: for any pair of points x, y ∈ X, we add an edge between x and y with probability g (|x − y|) independently of all other pairs. g(·) is called the connection function of the model and is a non- increasing function from IR + into [0, 1].\nAs an extension of this model, a directed connectivity graph can be generated simply by adding arcs between any pair of points independently with the same probability. Thus, for any pair of points x, y, we decide independently whether to add an arc from x to y and whether to add an arc between y and x, both with probability g (|x − y|). We call this modiﬁed model the Directed Random-Connection Model (DRCM).\nThe above deﬁnitions are quite intuitive but do not constitute formal deﬁnitions. However, rigorous deﬁnitions of the DBM (respectively DRCM) can be formulated by applying minor changes to the deﬁnition of the BM (respectively RCM). See e.g. [8] pages 14\u201320. In the interest of space, we skip this formal step.\n1) Undirected models: In undirected graphs, the percola- tion phenomenon is characterized by the emergence of an inﬁnite connected component as soon as the node density λ is above a certain threshold. More formally, for both Boolean and random-connection models, we denote by P 0 the Palm distribution of the model, i.e., the probability measure under the condition that X has a point located exactly at the origin 1 deﬁned as P 0 (·) := P · 0 ∈ X . Next, we denote by W un the connected component of the point located at the origin. We then deﬁne the percolation function as θ un (λ) := P 0 (|W un | = ∞) .\nThe main result of continuum percolation theory is that in both the BM and RCM, there exists a critical density λ un such that θ un (λ) = 0 if λ < λ un and θ un (λ) > 0 if λ > λ un . 2\n2) Directed models: In the directed case, one should take more care in deﬁning the the percolation function. Indeed, since connectedness is no-longer a symmetric relation, there\nis no natural deﬁnition of a connected component. Instead, we deﬁne several types of connected components:\nW out (out-component of the origin): the set of vertices that can be reached from the origin by following arcs of the connectivity graph\n\u2022 W in (in-component of the origin): the set of nodes from which one can reach the origin by following arcs of the connectivity graph\n\u2022 W s (strongly connected component of the origin): deﬁned as W out ∩ W in\nW vs (very strongly connected component of the origin): the set of points that are connected to the origin in both directions following the same path.\nThe latter component corresponds to the connected component of the origin if one discards all unidirectional links in the graph.\nFor each of the above sets, we deﬁne the respective per- colation functions and percolation thresholds similarly as in the undirected case. In order to avoid repetitions, we let \u2018x\u2019 denote successively \u2018out\u2019, \u2018in\u2019, \u2018s\u2019 and \u2018vs\u2019, and deﬁne the percolation function as θ x (λ) := P 0 (|W x | = ∞) , and the percolation threshold as λ x := inf{λ > 0 : θ x (λ) > 0}. Since W vs ⊆ W s = W out ∩ W in , we have immediately that θ vs (λ) ≤ θ s (λ) ≤ min{θ out (λ), θ in (λ)}, and thus λ vs ≥ λ s ≥ max{λ out , λ in }.\n3) Modiﬁed percolation functions: In order to formulate and prove our results, we need to deﬁne further (non-standard) percolation functions. For each type of component, using \u2018x\u2019 as a wildcard for \u2018un\u2019, \u2018out\u2019, \u2018in\u2019, \u2018s\u2019 and \u2018vs\u2019, we deﬁne\nand the corresponding modiﬁed thresholds µ x := inf{λ > 0 : γ x (λ) > 0}. γ x (λ) is, in words, a lower bound on the probability that two arbitrarily distant points are connected together. As we will see below, the corresponding threshold deﬁnes a stronger notion of percolation, which requires the origin to be connected not only to an inﬁnite number of nodes, but to a positive fraction of all the nodes. As for the standard thresholds, we have\nThe central question of this paper is whether the percolation thresholds deﬁned above are all different or whether some are equal. In a ﬁrst step, we show results that hold for both the DBM and the DRCM. Then, we show stronger results for the DRCM. For the sake of readability, in this section, we only state the results and explain how they relate to each other. The proofs are given in Section V.\nThe theorems in this section are consequences of the so- called FKG inequality and a uniqueness property, which we establish for the DBM and DRCM in Section V. Therefore, they apply also to any model for which one can establish\nsimilar properties. We start with a simple lemma that shows that our modiﬁed percolation thresholds are actually higher than the standard ones.\nLemma 1: For \u2018x\u2019 denoting either \u2018un\u2019, \u2018out\u2019, \u2018in\u2019, \u2018s\u2019 or \u2018vs\u2019, we have that λ x ≤ µ x .\nThis result is quite intuitive: above the standard threshold, the connected component of the origin W x is inﬁnite with non- zero probability, whereas above the modiﬁed threshold, every point of the graph has non-zero probability to be in W x . The latter property clearly implies the former.\nWe then proceed to the central theorem of this paper, which states that the modiﬁed percolation threshold for strong connectivity is the same as the modiﬁed percolation threshold for one-way connectivity.\nThe drawback of Theorem 1 is that it is formulated in terms of the modiﬁed percolation thresholds. The next theorem shows that for some types of connectivity, the two sorts of threshold are actually equivalent.\nTheorem 2: For \u2018x\u2019 denoting either \u2018un\u2019, \u2018s\u2019 or \u2018vs\u2019, it is the case that µ x = λ x . (notice that \u2018out\u2019 and \u2018in\u2019 are not listed)\nThe key ingredient of the proof of this theorem is the uniqueness of the inﬁnite connected component. Indeed, the undirected, strong and very strong connectivity relations are all symmetric and deﬁne an equivalence relation. Thus, they deﬁne equivalence classes \u2013the connected components\u2013 which form a partition of X. Hence, the event that two points are connected can be reformulated as the event that the two points belong to the same component. Moreover, percolation theory provides methods to show that in our models, there can only be one inﬁnite component. Thus, if two points are such that their component is inﬁnite, then necessarily they are connected.\nSuch a reasoning is of course not applicable to the out- and in-components because they do not deﬁne a partition of X. Nevertheless, we believe that for those components, the modiﬁed thresholds are also equal to the standard ones. Whereas we can prove this fact for the DRCM (see the section below), we can only conjecture this result for the DBM:\nThe conjecture, combined with Theorem 1, implies that λ out = λ in = λ s . This is conﬁrmed by the simulation results shown in Figure 1.\nThe DRCM represent only a small generalization of the RCM, and many critical values of these two models are actually equal. The following theorem allows to link the two models.\nTheorem 3: In the (D)RCM, the points processes W un , W out and W in are identically distributed. 3\nThe theorem implies that λ un = λ out = λ in and that µ un = µ out = µ in . Therefore, it also proves Conjecture 1 for the DRCM. We look now at the very strongly connected component W vs . Recall that W vs is deﬁned as the set of the\npoints that remain connected to the origin if one discards all unidirectional links in the connectivity graph. It is thus interesting to verify that the percolation threshold associated with it is indeed higher than the other thresholds.\nConsider a point x in W vs . By deﬁnition, there must be a sequence of points x 0 = 0, x 1 , . . . , x n = x such that for each i = 1, . . . , n, there is an arc from x i− 1 to x i and an arc from x i to x i− 1 . For each i, this happens with probability g 2 (|x i − x i− 1 |). This simple reasoning allows to see that in fact, the very strongly connected component in the DRCM with connection function g (·) follows the same distribution as the connected component in the RCM with connection function g 2 (·). Therefore, to show that λ un < λ vs , it is enough to show that in the RCM, replacing g (·) with g 2 (·) does increase the percolation threshold λ vs .\nDeriving the class of connection functions g for which it is the case is beyond the scope of this paper 4 . Instead, we show an example where the strict inequality can be easily proved.\nProposition 1: Consider the DRCM with connection func- tion g (x) = e −αx for some α > 0. In this model, we have λ s < λ vs .\nTo verify this proposition, it sufﬁces to observe that with an exponential connection function, doubling the exponent α is equivalent to decreasing the density λ by a factor 2 d .\nThe proof of the theorems and lemma below make use of the so-called FKG inequality 5 . This inequality states that increas- ing events, i.e. events that do not cease to occur if one adds points, edges or arcs in the graph, are positively correlated. The FKG inequality has been proved for the (undirected) Boolean model in [11], and the extension of their proof to the DBM is straightforward. However, to the knowledge of the author,\nsuch an inequality has not been established for the RCM, and a fortiori not for the DRCM. We have thus to establish a similar inequality for these models. Again, the proofs for the directed and undirected models are very similar, and we thus show it only for the undirected model.\nWe start with a formal deﬁnition of an increasing event. Consider two realizations of ω and ω \u2032 of the RCM. We deﬁne the partial ordering as ω ω \u2032 if and only if ω \u2032 can be obtained by adding points and edges to ω. An event A is called increasing if for every ω \t ω \u2032 we have 1 A (ω) ≤ 1 A (ω \u2032 ). Furthermore, we call an event B edge-dependent if we have 1 B (ω) = 1 B (ω \u2032 ) whenever ω and ω \u2032 contain the exact same set of edges (i.e. they differ only by the addition or removal of points of degree zero).\nLemma 2 (FKG inequality): If A and B are both increasing and edge-dependent events, then P(A ∩ B) ≥ P(A) P(B) .\nProof: The proof below is an adapted version of the proof by Roy[11]. We consider the lattice L n = (2 −n Z) d . For any k = (k 1 , . . . , k d ) ∈ Z d , let C n (k) denote the cell {x ∈ IR d : (k i − 1)2 −n < x i ≤ k i 2 −n for every i = 1, . . . , d} where\nx = (x 1 , . . . , x d ). Thus the cells C n (k) form a partition of IR d . For any unordered pair of cells C n (k) and C n (k \u2032 ), we deﬁne the random variable O n (k, k \u2032 ) to be equal to 1 if there exists an edge having an end in C n (k) and the other end in C n (k \u2032 ), and to 0 otherwise.\nLet F n be the σ-algebra generated by all the variables O n (k, k \u2032 ). Then for any edge-dependent event A, {1 A |F n , n ≥ 1} is a martingale with respect to F n . By the martingale convergence theorem, we have\nE 1 A F n → 1 A a.s. as n → ∞. \t (2) Also, E 1 A F n is a function of the variables O n (k, k \u2032 ). It is not too hard but tedious to verify that if A is an increasing event, then E 1 A F n is an increasing function of these variables. One can also verify that the joint distribution of the O n (k, k \u2032 ) fulﬁlls the lattice condition (Condition A in [10]) required to apply the standard FKG inequality. In the interest of space, we skip this veriﬁcation. Thus, for two increasing edge-dependent events A and B, we apply the FKG inequality to the two (increasing) functions E 1 A F n and E 1 B F n :\nLetting n tend to inﬁnity and applying Lebesgue\u2019s dominated convergence theorem, we have from (2)\nUsing a similar proof technique, one can actually show that the same inequality holds if one adds extra points to the underlying Poisson process 6 . Thus, for any z ∈ IR d and for\nAs explained in Section IV-A, Theorem 2 requires that the inﬁnite connected component is unique. The uniqueness of the inﬁnite component has been proved for the (undirected) Boolean model in [12]. Their proof can easily be adapted to prove the uniqueness of the inﬁnite strongly and very strongly connected components in the DBM.\nA similar uniqueness result for the RCM has been proved in [13]. Again, the proof proposed in this paper can easily be adapted to the DRCM to prove the uniqueness of the inﬁnite strongly and very strongly connected components.\nWe prove the lemma for the out-component, i.e. when \u2018x\u2019 denotes \u2018out\u2019. The other cases can be proved with identical arguments.\nDeﬁne the random variable R ∈ IR ∪ {∞} as the radius of W out , i.e. R := sup{|x| : x ∈ W out }. Now for some z ∈ IR d , consider the ball B (z) of unit volume centered on z. Using the deﬁnition of γ out (λ), we have that P 0 (W out ∩ B(z) = ∅) ≥ e −λ γ out (λ). It is easy to see that for any z ∈ IR d , {W out ∩ B (z) = ∅} ⊆ {R ≥ |z| − r d }, where r d denotes the radius of the unit d-dimensional ball. Thus, P 0 (R ≥ |z| − r d ) ≥ P 0 (W out ∩ B(z) = ∅) ≥ e −λ γ out (λ) ∀z ∈ IR d . This implies that, P 0 (R = ∞) ≥ e −λ γ out (λ). Furthermore, it is not hard to show that if R = ∞, then |W out | = ∞. Hence we have θ out (λ) = P 0 (|W out | = ∞) ≥ P 0 (R = ∞) ≥ e −λ γ out (λ), which implies that µ out ≥ λ out .\nThe fact that µ out = µ in follows immediately from the deﬁnition of γ out (λ) and γ in (λ) (which are also equal). The other equality is an immediate consequence of the FKG inequality: using (4), we have for any z ∈ IR d\nThis implies that γ s (λ) ≥ γ 2 out (λ) and hence that µ s ≤ µ out . Combined with (1), this proves the equality of the thresholds.\nWe show the proof for the undirected model; the other cases follow identical arguments. Denote by C ∞ the unique inﬁnite\nconnected component of the graph. For any point z, we have P 0 0 z z ∈ X\n≥ P 0 0 ∈ C ∞ z ∈ X P 0 z ∈ C ∞ z ∈ X ≥ P 0 (0 ∈ C ∞ ) P z ∈ C ∞ z ∈ X\nTherefore, we have γ un (λ) ≥ θ 2 un (λ), which, combined with Lemma 1, implies the result.\nThe equality of the distributions of W out and W in follows from the deﬁnition of the model. We show the equality of the distributions of W un and W out by a coupling argument: we start by generating an undirected graph G = (X, E) using the standard RCM. Then we generate a directed graph G d = (X, A) on the same set of points using the DRCM so that E and A are independent conditioned on X. Finally, we construct a set of \u201ccoupled\u201d edges E \u2032 such that the marginal distribution of G \u2032 = (X, E \u2032 ) is that of the RCM and such that W \u2032 un = W out , where W \u2032 un denotes the connected component of the origin in G \u2032 .\nWe construct E \u2032 by visiting each element of X and add the edges adjacent to it. We start at the origin and add an edge between the origin and all vertices that are direct successors of the origin in G d . Next, we inspect each of these direct successors by order of distance to the origin. Since G d is a.s. locally ﬁnite, there are ﬁnitely many of them. For each successor x, we proceed similarly as for the origin: we look at the direct successors of x in G d , excluding the vertices that we have already visited, and add edges to all of them.\nBy following this procedure, we eventually determine the set of edges that have an end in W out . For all the pairs that we have not visited, i.e. the pairs with both ends in outside of W out , we simply copy the edges from E.\nWe claim that this construction complies with the RCM, i.e. that the presence of and edge in E \u2032 between each pair of points has the correct probability and is indeed independent of all the other edges. To see this, consider two points x and\ny and observe that the presence of an edge between them depends a priori on the following events:\n∈ {1, 2, 3} indicating how x and y are connected to the origin in G d : F = 1 indicates that x and y are not in W out , F = 2 that x is visited ﬁrst in the above construction, and F = 3 that y is visited ﬁrst.\nThe event E \u2032 (x, y) that there is a edge between x and y in E \u2032 can be reformulated as:\nWe also note that E i (x, y), i = 1, 2, 3 are independent of each other and have the same probability g (|x − y|). Furthermore, we observe that F does not depend on the arcs between x and\ny and are thus independent of E i (x, y), i = 1, 2, 3. Hence, form (5) we get\nAlso, since E i (x, y), i = 1, 2, 3 have the same probability and are independent of F , we can conclude from (5) that E \u2032 (x, y) is also independent of F .\nAlthough the two models presented in this paper are exten- sions of rather simple existing models, they allow to capture the effect of directed links on the connectivity of wireless networks. We showed that using unidirectional links actually lowers the threshold for long-range two-way connectivity. Also, the proof of this main result can be generalized to more sophisticated models if some underlying results, which we have listed explicitly, are available for these models.\nAs a by-product, we provide an FKG inequality for the random-connection model, which may be of independent interest to readers interested in percolation theory."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"E.
