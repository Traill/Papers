Simpler deterministic models, like ADT models [2], cannot demonstrate this phenomenon because they are limited in the set of channel gains they can model. This paper reinterprets the Niesen and Maddah-Ali models through the lens of carry-free operations. We further explore these carry-free models by considering i.i.d. unknown fading networks. In the unknown fading con- text, a carry-free model can be further simpliﬁed to a max- superposition model, where signals are superposed by a nonlinear max operation. Unlike in relay-networks with known fading and linear superposition, we ﬁnd that decode-and-forward can perform arbitrarily better than compress-and-forward in max- superposition relay networks with unknown fading."},"body":{"text":"Channel models have always formed the foundation for un- derstanding and engineering wireless communication systems. The choice of model involves a tradeoff between simplicity and \u201cdistance\u201d from the real-world. Fig. 1 shows a spectrum of these models. Rayleigh-faded Gaussian models are among the most commonly used and have undoubtedly furthered the state-of-the-art in the ﬁeld. However, these models are com- plex, and this complexity can obscure the essential interaction between channels and the information ﬂowing through them.\nThis led to the development of the simple determinis- tic \u201cbubble-model\u201d by Avestimehr, Diggavi and Tse (ADT model) [2], which pictorially represents information ﬂows. The simplicity of these models led to progress on the relay and interference channels. However, the same simplicity prevents them from capturing the interference alignment phenomena observed in Gaussian fading channels. ADT models only model gains that are powers of two\u2014they are limited in their ability to capture real-valued channel gains.\nReal interference alignment exploits channel diversity and channel state information at the transmitter. Channel gains that\nare not just powers of two are essential to capture it. However, the naive approach leads to a different problem: the \u201ccarries\u201d in the multiplication of the channel gain and the signal break the bit-wise linearity (and hence the simplicity) of the model. To circumvent this issue, the models recently proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen [1] ignore these carries to preserve linearity and yet model generic channel gains. This inspires us to call these models \u201ccarry-free\u201d models. Essentially, these carry-free models replace a single real channel input by a discrete valued signal and a real channel gain by an LTI system (Fig. 2). Sections II and III give details of the carry-free interpretation of [1]. Section IV deals with MIMO channels.\nAs a summary, Table I provides a comparison of the different families of models. While neither ADT nor carry- free models provide direct mappings for individual instances of Gaussian networks, carry-free models are able to capture fractional degrees of freedom and real interference alignment.\nArmed with this new richer model, Section V attempts to understand another Gaussian phenomenon: communication over unknown i.i.d fading channels. A ﬁrst curiosity about such channels was conjectured in 1969 [5]\u2014even for continuous fading distributions the optimal input distribution is discrete. Since then many works have followed up to characterize unknown point-to-point models [6], [7], [8]. Gaussian channel capacities in this case behave as log(log SN R), as opposed to the log SN R scaling for channels with known fading.\nHowever, carry-free models for unknown fading channels are not deterministic. The input-output relationship in these models still contains the randomness from the unknown channel fading. We propose the max-superposition model in Section V that removes this randomness. The model builds from the observation that only the highest non-zero bit in a signal conveys information when the channel is unknown. The max-model explains how the energy level modulation\nscheme, which is optimal in the case of real channels [8], can in fact be thought of as simple pulse-position-modulation. A similar fact is true in networks with unknown fading. In the max-superposition model, superimposed signals are combined through the non-linear max-operator, as opposed to a linear sum (hence, the name).\nFinally, we note that the max-superposition model of the relay channel offers a surprise: partial-decode-and-forward can offer an unbounded gain over compress-and-forward.\nJust as in [2], the generalized deterministic models of [1] consider the binary-string representation of real numbers as a starting point. To interpret these models as \u201ccarry-free\u201d models we deﬁne carry-free arithmetic. Consider such a string a n a n−1 ...a 1 a 0 a −1 .... Let B be the set of all binary strings of inﬁnite length. We deﬁne carry-free addition, ⊕ c , and multiplication, ⊗ c , over B in the obvious way.\nLet c n ...c 1 c 0 c −1 ... = a n ...a 1 a 0 a −1 ... ⊕ c b n ...b 1 b 0 b −1 .... Then c i = a i + b i , where the sum is over F 2 . The addition operation involves no carryovers unlike in real addition. We derive the name \u201ccarry-free\u201d from this property. Bit interac- tions at one level do not affect higher level bits.\nLet c n ...c 1 c 0 c −1 ... = a n ...a 1 a 0 a −1 ... ⊗ c b n ...b 1 b 0 b −1 ... . Then c i =\na k b i−k , where the summations are in F 2 . Thus, multiplication is basically \u201cconvolution\u201d (Fig. 2), as noted in [1]. We note that it is commutative and associative.\nThe bit levels of carry-free numbers are like a fake \u201ctime\u201d. Signals convolve to interact\u2014just as carry-free strings multi- ply. The string a n ...a 1 a 0 a −1 ... can also be denoted as signal samples from −∞ to n: a[n]a[n − 1]...a[0]a[−1]....\nUnder the multiplication and addition deﬁned above, (B, ⊕ c , ⊗ c ) forms a commutative ring. There is a natural mapping from this ring to the polynomial ring. a n ...a 1 a 0 a −1 ... in B corresponds to a n z n + ... + a 1 z + a 0 + a −1 z −1 .... We can check the natural addition and multiplication in the polynomial ring is equivalent to ⊕ c and ⊗ c of B.\nWe will use a truncation operation similar to [2], [3], [4] to capture the effect of noise in a channel. For a polynomial a(z) =\nConsider a real Gaussian point-to-point channel, y = 2 n hx + w. h is a ﬁxed realization of a random channel gain uniform in [0, 1). The noise w is N (0, 1). For simplicity, we assume signal x has a peak-power constraint of 1 as in [2], and (2 n ) 2 represents the signal-to-noise ratio (SN R). We develop a carry-free model for this channel, parallel to the development of the ADT model, and consider bounded noise.\nConsidering the binary expansions of h and x, we have y = 2 n (h −1 2 −1 + h −2 2 −2 + ...)(x −1 2 −1 + x −2 2 −2 + ...) + (w −1 2 −1 +w −2 2 −2 +...). Replacing the binary expansion with polynomial notation, we get y(z) = z n (h −1 z −1 + h −2 z −2 + ...)(x −1 z −1 +x −2 z −2 +...)+(w −1 z −1 +w −2 z −2 +...), which we will shorten as y(z) = z n h(z)x(z) + w(z). We can think of w −i as fair coin ﬂips and write the channel equation as y(z) = z n h(z)x(z) . Here, h(z) is the channel polynomial, n = 1 2 log(SN R) and x(z) is the message polynomial. In matrix form 1 this is:\nor y = H · x. Thus, the capacity of the channel is the rank of the (n − 1) × (n − 1) matrix H, which is determined by the highest location where h i is non-zero.\nTheorem 3.1: The capacity of the carry-free point-to-point channel with the channel coefﬁcient h(z) = \t i h i z i and\nlog(SNR) = n is Rank(H) = n − min{i|h −i = 0}, where H is the matrix as above.\nThe crux of real interference alignment lies in understanding fractional degrees of freedom. A minimal model to understand this is the multiple-access channel. An interesting question about fractional degrees of freedom was implicitly posed and answered positively in [9], [10]: can we achieve ( 1 2 , 1 2 ) d.o.f. without time-sharing or CSIT 2 (channel state information at transmitters)? This question is answered for carry-free models by Niesen and Maddah-Ali [1].\nConsider a carry-free MAC with no CSIT: y(z) = 2 n h(z)a(z) + 2 n h (z)b(z) with n = 1 2 log(SN R) . In other\nwords, h(z) and h (z) are only known to the receiver, and transmitters are not allowed any cooperation or common ran- domness for time-sharing. Clearly, the cut-set bound implies that the total d.o.f. of the channel is bounded by 1. The scheme follows [9], [1], and sets the lower order bits to zero as described in Fig. 3.\nTheorem 3.2: Each transmitter can achieve 1 2 d.o.f. without timesharing or CSIT for almost all channel gains.\nThe natural next channel to explore is the X-channel, and here too, carry-free models can capture the notion of fractional degrees of freedom as in the Gaussian case, as shown in [1].\nThe following 2 × 2 MIMO example from [2] illustrates a limitation of the ADT model:\nThis channel has 2 d.o.f under the Gaussian model, but only one under ADT models. However, carry-free models represent the channel as h 11 (z) = z k−1 +z k−2 , h 12 (z) = z k , h 21 (z) = z k , h 22 (z) = z k and can capture the 2 d.o.f.\nUnfortunately, the carry-free model cannot solve this prob- lem generally. There is no simple correspondence between a speciﬁc instance of a real 2 × 2 MIMO model and a speciﬁc carry-free model. Consider the channel\nwith 1 d.o.f. under the real Gaussian model. However, the cor- responding carry-free model with h 11 (z) = z 3 + 1, h 12 (z) = z + 1, h 21 (z) = z + 1, h 22 (z) = 1 has 2 d.o.f., since its determinant in the polynomial ring is non-zero. But\nhas 2 d.o.f. under the real Gaussian model. Under the carry- free model, the channel coefﬁcients are h 11 (z) = z 2 + 1, h 12 (z) = z + 1, h 21 (z) = z + 1, h 22 (z) = 1, which lead to determinant 0.\nThis inconsistency between the carry-free model and the Gaussian model seems to arise from the fact that numbers behave differently under the two algebras because of the lack of carryovers. For instance, 5, a prime integer, is composite in the carry-free ring (101 = 11 ⊗ c 11). This is the primary difﬁculty in building a direct map from Gaussian instances to their carry-free counterparts.\n1) Point-to-point carry-free model: Consider the carry-free model for a channel with unknown i.i.d fading as in Fig. 4. The basic setup builds from earlier sections 3 : y(z) = h(z)x(z)\nwhere h(z) = h 0 + h −1 z −1 + · · · and x(z) = x n z n + x n−1 z n−1 + · · · + x 0 . Here, h i are i.i.d. Bernoulli− 1 2 random variables which are unknown to both the transmitter and the receiver, and x i ∈ {0, 1}.\nThe ﬁrst thing to note is that this carry-free channel is not deterministic\u2014the randomness from the fading introduces randomness in the input-output relationship. Next, observe that once the maximum bit level in the output is ﬁxed, the randomness introduced by the channel forces all bits below the maximum level to be Bernoulli- 1 2 random variables which are independent from the input. Therefore, we focus our attention on the highest 1 received in y(z). Deﬁne,\n−1 \t if y(z) = 0 max{i|y i = 1} if y(z) = 0\nThe key observation is that x q and y q are sufﬁcient statistics of x(z), y(z) for y(z), x(z) respectively, and this is captured in the following lemma.\nLemma 5.1: P (y q = x q − i) = 1 2 i+1 for 0 ≤ i ≤ x q and P (y q = −1) = 1 2 x q +1 . Moreover, x(z)\u2014x q \u2014y q \u2014y(z) form a Markov chain, and I(y(z); x(z)) = I(y q ; x(z)) = I(y q ; x q ).\nThe proof of this lemma is simple and omitted for space constraints. We use the lemma to calculate the capacity of this channel, C cf = max p(x(z)) I(x(z); y(z)).\nTheorem 5.2: The capacity of the carry-free point-to-point channel is log (n + 2) − 3 ≤ C cf ≤ log(n + 2).\nThe achievable scheme involves using monomials z x q as the channel input x(z) and parallels pulse-position modulation. The converse follows from Lemma 5.1.\n2) Point-to-point max-model: The observations above sug- gest that the essence of communicating over unknown fading channels is captured by the highest non-zero bits of the input and output. Hence, we propose the max-model, which depends only on the maximal bit of the signal. Let x ∈ {0, 1, 2 · · · n} represent the position of the maximal bit in the input signal. Then, y, the position of the maximal bit in the output signal is represented as simply as\nIt is easy to see that the capacity of this channel is C max = log(n + 1).\n3) Point-to-point real model: The key point of this section is to give an intuitive explanation of the log log SN R result for communication over unknown fading channels. For a channel with uniform distribution: Y = H · X + W , unknown i.i.d. fading H ∼ U [0, 1], input power constraint E[X 2 ] ≤ P and noise W ∼ U [0, 1].\nThe optimal achievable scheme for this channel is to mod- ulate the energy-level, and there are n = log P of those available. The different signal values (logarithmically spaced) which are used as inputs can be thought of as pulse-positions for standard pulse-position-modulation. The observation that\nlog |Y | + is an approximate sufﬁcient statistic for Y , clearly illustrates the insight and applicability of the max-model to this problem.\n1) The carry-free MAC: Next we move to the carry- free unknown MAC. y(z) = h(z)a(z) + h (z)b(z) where h(z) = h 0 + h −1 z −1 + · · · and h (z) = h 0 + h −1 z −1 + · · ·\nare unknown at the transmitter and receiver. Let a(z) = a n 1 z n 1 + · · · + a 0 and b(z) = b n 2 z n 2 + · · · + b 0 , and y q , a q , and b q are deﬁned as in the previous section.\nJust as in the point-to-point case, the randomness introduced by the fading restricts the information communicated across the channel to the maximal power level over the two input signal, and y q depends only on max{a q , b q }. This intuition is captured in Lemma 5.3. We omit the proof.\nLemma 5.3: P (y q = max{a q , b q } − i) = 1 2 i+1 \t for 0 ≤ i ≤ max{a q , b q } and P (y q = −1) = 1 2 max{a q ,b q }+1 . Further, \t a(z), b(z)\u2014a q , b q \u2014max{a q , b q }\u2014y q \u2014y(z) form \t a \t Markov \t chain. \t Hence, I(y(z); a(z), b(z)) = I(y q ; a(z), b(z)) = I(y q ; a q , b q ).\nJust as in the point-to-point case, Lemma 5.3 suggests a deterministic model, described in the next section.\n2) The max-superposition MAC: Finally, we come to the example which gives the max-superposition model its name. Let a, b ∈ {0, 1, 2 · · · n} represent the highest non-zero bits of the two input signals in a MAC. Then the output, y, of the channel depends only on the maximum of the two signals:\nThe very nature of this model suggests that it is not possible for both encoders to simultaneously communicate information. Theorem 5.4 below proves that the timesharing rate region is optimal to within one bit.\nTheorem 5.4: The achievable rate region for the max- superposition MAC consists of all positive rate pairs (R 1 , R 2 ) such that\nFurther, this region is tight to within 1 bit for both R 1 and R 2 \u2014 namely all achievable pairs must satisfy:\nlog(n 2 + 1)(R 1 − 1) + log(n 1 + 1)(R 2 − 1) ≤ \t (8) log(n 1 + 1) log(n 2 + 1)\n3) The real MAC: Consider the real valued MAC: Y = H · A + H · B + W , with H, H and W are indepen- dent U [0, 1] and unknown at the transmitter and receiver, and A, B are subject to quadratic power constraints P 1 and P 2 . The maximum bit-levels n 1 , n 2 from the carry free model are equal to n 1 = log P 1 , n 2 = log P 2 . Like the max-superposition MAC, we can prove a theorem similar to Thm. 5.4 and prove that timesharing is approximately optimal.\nAt ﬁrst glance, it would seem that there is no point to even thinking about coordination or beam-forming style gains by the relays in an unknown fading network. Compress-and- forward seems like the right approximately optimal scheme. However, this section gives an example of a relay network where surprisingly, partial-decode-and-forward can inﬁnitely outperform compress-and-forward style schemes, and there is a signiﬁcant coordination gain\u2014traditionally known as beam- forming gain\u2014to be exploited. This observation is quite inter- esting when we remind ourselves that the beam-forming gain is usually bounded by a constant in known-fading Gaussian networks with linear superposition, and compress-and-forward is the optimal in linear ADT relay networks [2]. 4\nIn the previous section, we saw that the max operation essentially captures superposition in i.i.d. unknown fading networks. We focus on a speciﬁc max-superposition relay network shown in Fig. 5. Channels connecting X 1 to Y 1 and X 2 to Y 2 are orthogonal noiseless links with rate R each. The MIMO channel connecting X 3 , X 4 to Y 3 , Y 4 is a max-superposition deterministic model. We consider X 3 ∈ {0, 1, · · · , n}, X 4 ∈ {0, 1, · · · , n} and\nn ) + ) \t (9) Y 4 = max((X 3 −\nThe shifted max-operation captures the difference between the direct-link and cross-link gains in the original Gaussian MIMO channel. The cross links are weaker than the direct links, but not by much in a proper scaling.\nn, Y 3 = X 3 and Y 4 = (X 3 −\nn ) + . Thus, both the received signals only depend on X 3 , and X 4 is useless. Moreover, when X 3 and X 4 are independent and their ranges are large, with high probability the difference between X 3 and X 4 is greater than √\nn and both Y 3 and Y 4 only depend on either X 3 or X 4 . Therefore, in compress-and-forward (where X 3 and X 4 are chosen independently), the throughput is essentially bounded by log n which is the maximum entropy of a single input.\nHowever, decode-and-forward can exploit the coordination gain between X 3 and X 4 . We can keep the difference within √\nn and let Y 3 , Y 4 depend on both X 3 , X 4 . The key observa- tion is that when the quotients of X 3 , X 4 divided by\nn are the same, X 3 , X 4 have to be within\nn. To keep the quotients the same, we transfer a common message m 0 to both relays as the common quotient.\nAn approximately optimal partial-decode-and-forward scheme is described in Fig. 5. The transmitter divides the message into three parts m 0 , m 1 , m 2 ∈ {0, 1, · · · ,\nn − 1}. The common message m 0 is sent to both relays and used as a quotient. The private messages m 1 and m 2 are transmitted to Rel 1 and Rel 2 respectively and used as remainders. In other words, X 3 and X 4 are chosen as\n√ n m 0 + m 1 and √\nY 3 and Y 4 also have to equal X 3 and X 4 (eqs. (9), (10)). Moreover, since the ranges of m 0 , m 1 , m 2 are\nachievable rate of this partial-decode-and-forward can increase to 3 2 log n.\nWe summarize our understanding in Thm. 5.5 and Fig. 6. The real-channel counterparts are not hard to derive.\nTheorem 5.5: Let C rel be the capacity of the relay channel given as above. The cut-set bound gives the upperbound\nThe proposed partial-decode-and-forward scheme gives the following lower bound.\nThis scheme is approximately optimal within a constant gap. Since compress-and-forward cannot exploit a \u201cbeam-forming\ngain\u201d, it can perform inﬁnitely worse than the partial-decode- and-forward scheme.\nIn this paper, we explore carry-free models and their various applications. The ability of carry-free models to capture di- verse channel gains illustrates how real-interference alignment works in Gaussian models. This diversity also allows us to model unknown fading. We also observe that in unknown fading networks the carry-free models can be further sim- pliﬁed to max-superposition models. These max-superposition networks show a curious property\u2014arbitrarily large \u201cbeam- forming\u201d like gains\u2014that needs more exploration.\nThe authors would like to thank the NSF for grants NSF- 07291222, NSF-0917212, and NSF-0932410, Guy Bresler and Abolfazl Motahari for helpful discussions, and the reviewers for suggested changes to the results."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"U.
