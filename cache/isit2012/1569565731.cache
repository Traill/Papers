In this paper, we use an extension of Construction A called Construction A \u2032 to obtain Barnes-Wall lattices from linear codes over polynomials rings. To obtain the Barnes-Wall lattice BW 2 m in C 2 m for any m ≥ 1, we ﬁrst identify a linear code C 2 m over the quotient ring U m = F 2 [u] u m and then propose a mapping ψ : U m → Z[i] such that the code L 2 m = ψ( C 2 m ) is a lattice constellation. Further, we show that L 2 m has the cubic shaping property when m is even. Finally, we show that BW 2 m can be obtained through Construction A \u2032 as BW 2 m = (1 + i) m Z[i] 2 m ⊕ L 2 m ."},"body":{"text":"with regular polynomial addition and multiplication over F 2 coefﬁcients along with the quotient operation u m = 0, which is equivalent to cancelling all the terms of degree greater than or equal to m.\nDeﬁnition 3: A subset of U n m denoted by C is called a linear code over U m if C can be obtained through a generator matrix G ∈ U k ×n m as\nfor some k ≤ n and the matrix multiplication is over the ring U m .\nUsing the above deﬁnitions, we now discuss the subject matter of this paper. Systematic use of binary error-correcting codes to construct some structured lattices is well known in the literature [1]. For example, the checkerboard lattice D 2 ⊂ R 2 can be constructed as (Chapter 4, Section 7, [1])\nwhere L = {ψ(c) | ∀c ∈ C} is an Euclidean code obtained by embedding the codewords of C the repetition code (2, 1, 2) over F 2 = {0, 1} into the Euclidean space using the mapping ψ : F 2 → Z such that ψ(0) = 0 and ψ(1) = 1. Depending on the structure of the underlying linear error correcting codes, lattice construction can be categorized into different types [1]. In this paper, we consider a special class of constructions called Construction A which is deﬁned formally as follows:\nDeﬁnition 4: (Sec. 2, Chapter 5, [1]) A lattice Λ over Z is obtained as Construction A from the binary linear code C if Λ can be represented as\nwhere L = {ψ(c) | ∀c ∈ C} ⊂ Z n is an Euclidean code obtained by the component-wise mapping ψ : F 2 → Z given by ψ(0) = 0 and ψ(1) = 1 on the alphabet of C.\nIn the above deﬁnition, the linear code C is restricted to be over F 2 and Λ is viewed as a lattice over Z. However, in general, we could also view Λ as a complex lattice, i.e., as a lattice over Z[i], and construct Λ using linear code C over ﬁnite rings. We introduce a new construction of lattices by relaxing the constraint on the alphabet of the linear code C. Our construction is an extension of Construction A and hence, we refer it as Construction A \u2032 . For the most generalized\nwith Φ(u) = 1 + i. At this stage, we point out that EC 2 m is an arbitrary subset of BW 2 m and does not have cubic shaping. To ﬁx this problem, we provide a one- one mapping ϕ : EC 2 m → L 2 m ⊂ BW 2 m such that L 2 m has cubic shaping property for even values of m (Section IV). With this, the mapping ψ (as in Deﬁnition 5) is the composition mapping ϕ(Φ( ·)) on U m , and we show that BW 2 m is obtained as\nMore details on this work can be found in [8]. Apart from providing further details on Construction A \u2032 of Barnes-Wall lattices, a thorough study on the performance of Euclidean codes from Barnes-Wall lattice constellations is also reported in [8] .\nNotations: Throughout the paper, boldface letters and capi- tal boldface letters are used to represent vectors and matrices, respectively. For a complex matrix X, the matrices X T , ℜ(X) and ℑ(X) denote, respectively, the transpose, real part and imaginary part of X. For a vector x, we use x j to represent the j-th component of x. The set of all integers, the real numbers, and the complex numbers are, respectively, denoted by Z, R, and C, and i =\n√ −1. Cardinality of a set S is denoted by |S|. Absolute value of a complex number x is denoted by |x|. The number of ways of picking n objects out of m objects is denoted by C m n . The n-length zero vector is denoted by 0 n\nFirst, we recall Construction D of Barnes-Wall lattices, and subsequently propose its Construction A \u2032 from a suitable code.\nBarnes-Wall lattice can be obtained via Construction D [4] as a Z[i] lattice as follows: Suppose we want to construct the lattice BW 2 m of dimension 2 m where m ≥ 1, let RM(r, m) be the binary Reed-Muller (RM) code (Sec. 3.7, Chapter 3, [2]) of length 2 m and of order 0 ≤ r ≤ m. With this, BW 2 m can be constructed as in (3) given at the top of next page, where ψ( ·) is as given in Deﬁnition 4. For notational convenience, we also write (3) as\nThis method generates BW 2 m as a multi-level structure of nested RM codes and hence it falls under Construction D [1].\nExample 1: BW 4 (which is also known as E 8 over Z) is constructed as\nwhere the code RM(1, 2) = (4, 3, 2) and the code RM(0, 2) = (4, 1, 4) in the classical (n, k, d min ) format.\nBW 16 = (1 + i) 4 Z[i] 16 ⊕ (1 + i) 3 (16, 15, 2) ⊕ (1 + i) 2 (16, 11, 4) ⊕ (1 + i)(16, 5, 8) ⊕ (16, 1, 6).\n   \n1 1 1 1 0 u 0 u 0 0 u u 0 0 0 0\n  \nEncoding of C 2 m : Let z ∈ U 2 m m , i.e., the j-th component of z is given by\nwhere b k,j ∈ F 2 for all k, j. Using z and G 2 m , the code C 2 m ⊂ U 2 m m can be obtained as\nProposition 1: The rate of the code C 2 m in bits per code- word is ( m 2 )2 m .\nProof: Each component of z carries m information bits in the variables b k,j as shown in (8). This amounts to a total of m2 m bits carried by z. However, since the matrix multiplication is over U m , not all the information bits b k,j are encoded as codewords of C 2 m (due to u m = 0). Using the structure of G 2 m it is possible to identify the indices (k, j) of information bits b k,j which get encoded into the codewords of C 2 m as follows: Let the set I q denote the indices of the rows of G 2 m whose components take values from the binary set {0, u q } for q = 0, 1, · · · m − 1. Due to the quotient operation u m = 0, the components of z which are in the index set I q are restricted to be of the form, z j =\nb k,j u k ∀j ∈ I q . For example, z 1 =\nb k,1 u k and z 2 m = 0. Using the structure of G 2 m we observe that |I q | = C m q , and hence ﬁnd the total number of information bits on a codeword of C 2 m as\n(m − k)C m k . Therefore, the rate of C 2 m in bits per codeword is\nWe now provide an example for the proposed encoding technique, showcasing the positions of the information bits that get encoded to the codewords of C 2 m .\nExample 6: For m = 3, the input vector z and G 8 are of the form,\n           \n           \n           \n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 u 0 u 0 u 0 u 0 0 u u 0 0 u u 0 0 0 u 2 0 0 0 u 2 0 0 0 0 u u u u 0 0 0 0 0 u 2 0 u 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 u 2 u 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n           \n      \n    \n      \n    \n      \n      \n. Note that G RM is the nested RM generator matrix. We use the notation ¯ B = [¯ B 0 ¯ B 1 · · · ¯B m ]. We also point out that the informations bits in each row of ¯ B are encoded to RM codewords of appropriate order by the matrix multiplication ¯ BG RM . Due to zero entries in ¯ B , the matrix ¯ B has only\nC m n information bits in the k-th row of ¯ B for k = 1, 2, · · · m. Since, these\nC m n bits are placed in the ﬁrst as many columns of ¯ B , the information bits in the k-th row of ¯ B are encoded into a RM codeword of (k − 1)-th order. Finally, on the multiplication of u from left, the generated RM codewords are appropriately weighed by powers of u and added. This proves the equivalence of our construction to Construction D.\nTill now, we have identiﬁed the linear code C 2 m and its encoding technique over the quotient ring U m . In the next subsection, we discuss embedding of C 2 m into the Euclidean space Z[i] 2 m .\nBy using the map Φ(u) = 1 + i on C 2 m , we get a Euclidean code given by\nIt is to be noted that EC 2 m is an arbitrary subset of BW 2 m and does not have cubic shaping. To ﬁx this problem, we propose a one-one mapping ϕ on EC 2 m to obtain a new Euclidean code denoted by L 2 m such that L 2 m has cubic shaping when m is even. For any x = [x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , · · · , x 2 m ] ∈ EC 2 m , the mapping ϕ operates on each component of x as,\n2 , when m is even; φ\n    \nTheorem 2: The Euclidean code L 2 m and the lattice BW 2 m are related as BW 2 m = (1 + i) m Z[i] 2 m ⊕ L 2 m .\nBarnes-Wall lattice point. Further, the constants added in (14) are such that\nfor some a, b ∈ Z[i]. Therefore, φ(¯x) continues to be a Barnes- Wall lattice point. We also know that x = (1 + i) m r + ϕ(x), for some r ∈ Z[i] 2 m and ϕ(x) ∈ L 2 m . Finally, from (15), we have\nThe ﬁrst equality in the above equation follows as (1 + i) m is of the form a2 m −1 2 where a = ±1 ± i. This completes the proof when m is odd.\nUsing the results of Theorem 2, the Construction A \u2032 of BW 2 m is given by BW 2 m = (1 + i) m Z[i] 2 m ⊕ L 2 m , where L 2 m is the Euclidean code obtained from C 2 m through the mapping ψ = ϕ(Φ( ·)) on U m .\nIn this paper, we have introduced an extension of Construc- tion A to obtain the class of Barnes-Wall lattices from linear codes over rings. We highlight that the mapping ψ provides the cubic shaping property on the Euclidean code, which in turn facilitates labelling of information bits if the Euclidean code is to be used as a coded modulation scheme.\nThis work was performed within the Monash Software De- ﬁned Telecommunications Lab and supported by the Monash Professional Fellowship 2011."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"H.
