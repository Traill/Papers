A fading channel dominates another in the capacity ordering sense, if the ergodic capacity of the ﬁrst is greater than that of the second at all values of average signal to noise ratio. We show that many parametric fading models such as the Nakagami-m, Rician and Hoyt fading satisfy the capacity order, in the sense that the distribution with a larger line of sight parameter is larger in the ergodic capacity sense. Further, we obtain closure properties of the capacity order for the ﬁrst time, because such a stochastic order has not been considered in either stochastic ordering literature, or information theory literature. Through these properties, we develop sufﬁcient conditions for comparing the ergodic capacity of a composite system involving multiple capacity ordered fading links with cod- ing/decoding capabilities only at the transmitter/receiver, when operated in two different fading scenarios. Such comparisons can be made even in cases when a closed form expression for the ergodic capacity of the composite system is not analytically tractable. We also show that capacity ordering of point-to-point links has applications to multiple access channels."},"body":{"text":"Consider a fading channel with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), where the receiver has perfect channel side information (CSI). The ergodic capacity in this case is known to be E [log (1 + ρX)], where ρX is the instantaneous signal to noise ratio (SNR), and ρ > 0 represents the average SNR.\nIn this work, we deﬁne a new partial order on the instanta- neous SNR of fading channels, which can be used to compare two different fading channels. A fading channel is said to be better than another in the ergodic capacity order (or capacity order, for short), if its corresponding ergodic capacity is bigger for all ρ. The proposed deﬁnition falls under the general theory of integral stochastic orders, which is well-studied in the ﬁeld of reliability analysis [1], actuarial sciences [2] and economics [3]. There are many stochastic orders which have been previously established. A comprehensive exposition can be found in [4]. Previously, the stochastic Laplace transform (LT) order, which compares the real-valued Laplace transforms of random variables (RVs) has been used to compare two fading distributions by comparing the average error rate of M -QAM modulations [5]. This draws intuition from the fact that error rates of some modulations are positive mixtures of decaying exponentials, which can also be viewed as the Laplace transform. It has been shown in [5] that Laplace transform ordering of instantaneous SNRs implies ordering of ergodic capacities, but not conversely. This occurs because ergodic capacity is the maximum average achievable rate,\nobtained by coding over an i.i.d time extension of the fading channel, which provides more inherent time diversity; through coding, it is possible to make one channel offer better error rates than the other at all SNR, even when this is not possible in the absence of coding.\nFor the ﬁrst time in (information theory, and stochastic or- dering) literature, we deﬁne and obtain many useful properties of the capacity order, which can be applied to compare the performance of wireless communication systems across two different fading channels. Further, we show that many of the parametric fading models such as the Nakagami- m, Rician and Hoyt fading satisfy the capacity order with respect to their line of sight parameters. For systems involving multiple fading coefﬁcients, we establish sufﬁcient conditions on when the ergodic capacity of the composite system is bigger, when each fading link is capacity ordered. Such comparisons of ergodic capacities can be made even in cases when a closed-form expression is not available. As simple illustrative examples, we investigate diversity combining systems. We also consider the multi-hop amplify-forward relay, whose ergodic capacity in fading is intractable in closed form, and show that under certain conditions, if a better set of channels used to form the relay system, the composite system has a higher ergodic capac- ity. Our results also extend to multi-user information theory. More speciﬁcally, we show that the ergodic capacity region of a multiple access channel is larger, when the single-input single-output (SISO) channel between the destination and each user in the absence of all other users is better. However, for certain system conﬁgurations, element-wise ergodic capacity ordering does not imply overall system capacity ordering at all SNR ρ. Examples include the multi-hop amplify-forward relay.\nA function g : (0, ∞) → R is a Bernstein function, if g(x) ≥ 0, and g is inﬁnitely differentiable with\nfor n ∈ N. An equivalent condition to (1) is that g(x) admits the representation [6, p. 15]\nfor some a, b ≥ 0, which is a Lebesgue integral with respect to a positive measure µ on (0, ∞), which satisﬁes the conver- gence condition 1 0 µ(ds) + ∞ 1 sµ(ds) < ∞. The set of all Bernstein functions is denoted by BF.\nAn important property is that the set BF is closed under conic combinations: if g i ∈ BF, and a i ≥ 0, i = 1, . . . , N, then N i=1 a i g i ∈ BF. Some examples of Bernstein functions are g(x) = x α , for 0 < α < 1, g(x) = x/(1 + x) and g(x) = log(1+x). The representation of the capacity function log(1 + x) in the form (2) is particularly useful, and is given by\nA Bernstein function g is called a Thorin-Bernstein function [6, pp. 73-79], if it admits the representation given by (2), where sµ(s) is completely monotone (c.m.). Recall that a function ˜ g : (0, ∞) → R is c.m. if and only if it satisﬁes\nand n ∈ N∪{0}. The family of all Thorin-Bernstein functions is denoted by T BF. A necessary and sufﬁcient condition for g : (0, ∞) → (0, ∞) to be in T BF is that g can be represented as follows [6, p. 73]:\nfor some a, b ≥ 0 and µ is a positive measure on (0, ∞), which satisﬁes the convergence condition 1 0 | log s|µ(ds) +\ns −1 µ(ds) < ∞. Thorin-Bernstein functions are closed under conic combinations, and also under compositions i.e. for g 1 , g 2 ∈ T BF, g 1 ◦ g 2 ∈ T BF. This subclass of BF is of particular relevance to this paper, since the Shannon capacity function C(x) := log (1 + x) is not only in BF, but is also a Thorin-Bernstein function, which can be seen from (3) and (5).\nIt is useful to deﬁne a multivariate extension of a Thorin- Bernstein function as follows: A function g : R m → R ∈ T BF if g(x 1 , . . . , x m ) is in T BF when x j , j = 1, . . . , m, is treated as the variable, while all other arguments are treated as constants.\nIn this subsection, we review some of the tools provided by the stochastic ordering framework.\nLet G denote a class of real valued functions g : R + → R, and X and Y be random variables (RVs) with distribution functions F X (·) and F Y (·) respectively. We deﬁne the integral stochastic order with respect to G as [2]:\nwhere E [·] is the expectation. In this case, G is known as a generator of the order ≤ G . We now give two examples of integral stochastic orders relevant to this paper, by specifying the corresponding generator set of functions G.\n1) Convex Order: In this case G is the set of all convex functions, and the order is denoted as X ≤ cx Y . Applying (6) using g(x) = x and g(x) = −x (both of which are convex), we have E [X] = E [Y ] whenever X and Y are convex ordered. Therefore, convex ordering establishes that the RVs have the same mean and X is \u201cless variable\u201d than Y .\nPerformance metrics such as error rates of two-dimensional modulations, and the negative capacity function − log(1 + ρx), ρ > 0 are convex functions of the instantaneous SNR. Therefore, establishing convex ordering of two instantaneous SNR RVs can enable comparing the average performance of the same system subject to fading modeled by two RVs.\n2) Laplace Transform Order: This partial order compares random variables based on their Laplace Transforms. Here, G = {g(x) : g(x) = − exp (−ρx) , ρ ≥ 0}, so that X ≤ Lt Y if and only if\nE [exp(−ρY )] ≤ E [exp(−ρX)] ∀ ρ ≥ 0 . \t (7) One useful property of LT ordered random variables is that for all c.m. functions g, we have\nIn other words, the generator G can be replaced by the set of all c.m. functions without changing the stochastic order [2]. In a wireless communications context, we interpret ρX and ρY\nas the instantaneous SNRs of two fading distributions, and g(x) as the instantaneous SER of a modulation scheme with c.m. error rate function. For example, for BPSK modulation, g(x) = Q √ 2ρx is c.m. in x. Further, for every g ∈ BF, we have the following useful relation\nClearly, for g(x) = log (1 + ρx), (9) provides a method to compare the ergodic capacities of two fading channels with X ≤ Lt Y .\nIn this section, we describe a new stochastic order, known as the capacity order. A. Deﬁnition\nA random variable X is said to be dominated by another random variable Y in the capacity order sense if and only if\nE [log (1 + ρX)] ≤ E [log (1 + ρY )] , \t (10) ∀ρ ≥ 0, and is denoted by X ≤ c Y . Here, E [log (1 + ρX)] can be interpreted as the ergodic capacity of a fading channel with instantaneous SNR ρX and average SNR ρ. Thus, X ≤ c Y dictates an order between the ergodic capacities of the two channels for every value of ρ. For this stochastic order, the generator is chosen as G = {g(x) : g(x) = log (1 + ρx) , ρ ≥ 0}. Next, we develop some useful properties of the capacity order.\nFor any two independent positive valued RVs X, Y , the following statements are true:\n5) For X 1 , . . . , X M independent and Y 1 , . . . , Y M inde- pendent, if X m ≤ c Y m ∀m = 1, . . . , M, then g (X 1 , . . . , X M ) ≤ c g (Y 1 , . . . , Y M ), for every g : R M → R which is a multivariate T BF.\nThe proofs of the properties can be found in the appendix. We note that properties 1, 2 and 3 can also be seen to hold for every g ∈ BF, when ≤ c is replaced by ≤ Lt in these properties.\nInterpreting ρX and ρY as the instantaneous SNRs of two different fading channels, the above properties of capacity ordered RVs prove to be essential in obtaining the conditions under which the ergodic capacity of a composite system with coding/decoding capabilities only at the transmitter/receiver under the channel Y is greater than that under X at all SNR.\nImportantly, Property 4 suggests that every pair of Laplace transform ordered random variables will also be capacity ordered, and this fact is used as a sufﬁcient condition to verify if two random variables are capacity ordered. Interestingly, the converse is not true, and we now give a counterexample, which was also given in [5], but we include it here for the sake of completeness. In an interference dominated system, the instan- taneous signal to interference ratio X is distributed according to the Pareto law F X (x) = x β /(1 + x β ), x > 0, β > 0 [7], for which it can be shown that\nwhich is a decreasing function of β, as seen by differentiating with respect to β. Thus, if X and Y are Pareto distributed with parameters β X ≥ β Y , the former is dominated by the latter in the capacity ordering sense. However, it can be shown through numerical integration that for β X ≥ β Y , E [exp(−ρY )] E [exp(−ρX)] , ∀ρ > 0 and thus X Lt Y . Thus, it is possible that the average error rate of M -QAM modulation in X is less than that in Y at high SNR, while the situation reverses when the capacity achieving code is applied on both channels. Interpreting the ergodic capacity as what is achievable by coding over an i.i.d. time-extension of the channel, we reach the conclusion that even though Y offers more diversity than X for an uncoded system, the i.i.d. extension of X lends itself to more diversity than that of Y . To put it more simply, at high SNR, it is possible for one channel to be superior to another in terms of error rates in the absence of coding, while being inferior when the capacity achieving code is employed over both channels.\nWe now give examples of pairs of RVs X, Y relevant to wireless communications, for which X ≤ c Y holds. In general, establishing capacity ordering using (10) is often\ninconclusive, since the integrals tend to be intractable. For- tunately, using Property 4, we can come up with RVs which obey capacity ordering.\nIt has been shown in [5] that when X and Y represent the instantaneous channel gains corresponding to Rician fading with parameters K X ≤ K Y , X ≤ Lt Y . Using Property 4, we see that under this condition X ≤ c Y is also true. This is true even for the case when X and Y correspond to the instantaneous channel gains of Nakagami fading with parameters m X ≤ m Y , or Hoyt fading with parameters q X ≤ q Y .\nIn what follows, we show that capacity ordering of a given SISO system under two different fading channels (possibly Rician with K X ≤ K Y ) can be used to make meaningful conclusions when a number of such systems are combined to form a system involving multiple random variables.\nIn order to illustrate the applicability of the capacity order to compare the performance of systems, we provide examples of composite systems where capacity ordering of component SISO systems can be used to conclude the capacity ordering of the system, and also some applications where this is not necessarily the case. Such generic conclusions can be made even when closed form expressions for the ergodic capacity are not available.\nTo begin with, we consider diversity combining schemes such as maximum ratio combining (MRC) and equal gain combining (EGC) using M receive antennas, for which we wish compare the ergodic capacity under two different fading channels with instantaneous channel gains X m ≤ c Y m , m = 1, . . . , M . To simplify the notation, we denote X := [X 1 , . . . , X M ], and likewise for Y.\n1) Maximum Ratio Combining: Conditioned on the instan- taneous channel gain X = x, the instantaneous channel gain after combining is given by g(x) = M m=1 x m . In order to verify that this is a T BF, treating x 1 as the variable, and all other arguments as constants, we get g(x 1 ; x 2 , . . . , x M ) = x 1 + k, where k = M m=2 x m . Clearly, g(x 1 ; x 2 , . . . , x M ) is T BF, since it satisﬁes the conditions of (5) with a = k, b = 1 and µ(u) = 0. Thus, by deﬁnition, g(x) is in T BF. Now, since X m ≤ c Y m , m = 1, . . . , M , from Property 5, we have g(X) ≤ c g(Y), which by deﬁnition implies that E [log (1 + ρg(X))] ≤ E [log (1 + ρg(Y))] , ∀ρ > 0. Thus, if Y is better than X component-wise, in the capacity order sense, then the MRC system with fading links given by Y will be better than that with X, in the capacity ordering sense, at all SNR.\n2) Equal Gain Combining: In this case, the combined in- stantaneous channel gain is given by g(x) = \t M m=1 √ x m 2 , where x is obtained by conditioning on X. In order to verify that g ∈ T BF, treating x 1 as the variable and all the other arguments of g as constants, we see that g(x 1 ; x 2 , . . . , x M ) = x 1 +2√x 1 k+k 2 , where k = M m=2 x m .\nClearly, g(x 1 ; x 2 , . . . , x M ) is in T BF, since it satisﬁes the conditions of (5) with a = k 2 , b = 1 and µ(s) = ks −1/2 /π. Repeating the same argument with all other arguments of g, we conclude that g ∈ T BF. Now, following similar arguments as in the MRC case, we infer that if a set of SISO systems X 1 , . . . , X M is component-wise dominated by Y 1 , . . . , Y M in the capacity ordering sense, then the EGC system with components Y will have a higher ergodic capacity than that formed using X at all SNR.\nWe now turn our attention to multi-hop amplify-forward relay systems, for which we show that in certain types of fading channels, component-wise ergodic capacity ordering of instantaneous SNRs results in capacity ordered relay system, while this does not hold in general. Exact expressions for the ergodic capacity in arbitrary fading channels are intractable, even for the two-hop case. Previously, the ergodic capacity of such a relay in fading channels has been obtained as an inﬁnite series in [8]. We now show through the framework of capacity ordering of channels, that even in the absence of closed-form expressions, it is possible for us to compare the ergodic capacities of the relay in two different fading channels.\nConsider an M -hop amplify-forward (AF) relay (refer Fig- ure 1), impaired by AWGN with variance σ 2 , where the instan- taneous channel gain on the m th link is given by X m in the ﬁrst system and Y m in the second system, for m = 1, . . . , M . Assume that X m ≤ c Y m . In this case, conditioned on the in- stantaneous channel gain X = x, the end-to-end SNR is given by g(x) = ( M m=1 [(1+x −1 m )]−1) −1 , when the amplitude gain of the i th relay is given by (x i−1 +σ 2 ) −1/2 [9]. In order to see if g ∈ T BF, treating x 1 as the variable and all other arguments of g as constants, we get g(x 1 ; x 2 , . . . , x M ) = kx 1 /(x 1 + k), where k = g(x 2 , . . . , x M ), which is not T BF according to [6, pp. 218]. However by straight-forward differentiation with respect to x 1 , it is observed that g is a Bernstein function in x 1 . The same justiﬁcation is valid for all other arguments of g. Therefore, g ∈ BF, but g / ∈ T BF. As a result, if the instantaneous channel gains also satisfy the stronger criterion X m ≤ Lt Y m , m = 1, . . . , M , then, using (9), we get g(X) ≤ Lt g(Y), and therefore g(X) ≤ c g(Y). However, if X m ≤ c Y m , while X m Lt Y m , m = 1, . . . , M then g(X) c g(Y). The latter is observed in the case where X m and Y m are Pareto distributed with parameters β X ≤ β Y . For example, Fig. 2 illustrates the numerically evaluated ergodic capacities of a multi-hop relay with M = 3 hops under Pareto distributed signal-to-interference ratio with parameters β X = 1 and β Y = 3, so that for each hop X m ≤ c Y m , m = 1, 2, 3 is\nsatisﬁed. It is observed from Fig. 2 that for ρ < ρ 0 , where ρ 0 ≈ 5 dB, X is a better channel than Y in the capacity order, while for ρ ≥ ρ 0 , the situation is reversed.\nIn this example, we focus on comparing the ergodic capacity regions of a multi-user Gaussian MAC network in two differ- ent fading scenarios. We consider the case where the number of users M is deterministic and constant for both the scenarios.\nLet X m , m = 1, . . . , M denote the instantaneous channel gains between each user and the destination. Conditioned on X = x, the capacity region is deﬁned by [10, pp. 407]\nwhere R m (ρx m ) represents the instantaneous rate of the m th user, g S (x) := S x m and S ⊂ 2 {1,...,M } . Observing that g S (x) is T BF in each variable, for X m ≤ c Y m , m = 1, . . . , M , we can deduce that g S (X) ≤ c g S (Y), ∀S ⊂ 2 {1,...,M } . Thus, the ergodic capacity region of an M -user Gaussian MAC is bigger in one system than another, when each user of the ﬁrst system has a higher ergodic capacity than the corresponding user in the second one.\nIn this paper, we deﬁne a new stochastic order known as the capacity order and obtain many useful properties, which can be exploited to obtain comparisons of ergodic capacities of com- posite systems across two different parametric fading channels, whose instantaneous SNRs satisfy the capacity order. We show that Nakagami- m, Rician and Hoyt fading are examples of such parametric fading distributions which satisfy the capacity order, each with respect to their line of sight parameters. Using the capacity order, we see that if a set of fading channels Y\nis better than another set of fading channels X component- wise in the capacity ordering sense, then the MRC or EGC system with components Y will have a higher ergodic capacity than that in X. As another application, we consider the multi- hop amplify-forward relay, and show that the the ergodic capacity of the relay is higher in a fading scenario, where the instantaneous SNRs are component-wise better than another in the Laplace transform ordering sense. Further, we show that if the instantaneous SNRs satisfy the capacity order, but not the Laplace transform order, then the previous conclusion need not hold. As another important example, we show that the ergodic capacity region of a multiple access channel is larger, when the SISO channel between the destination and each user in the absence of all other users is better.\nThis work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under Grant CCF 1117041.\nLet X, Y be non-negative RVs, such that X ≤ c Y . For ρ > 0, we have (1/ρ) E [log (1 + ρX)] ≤ (1/ρ)E [log (1 + ρX)]. Now, moving the 1/ρ term inside the expectation on both sides, we take the limit as ρ → 0. The limit and expectation can be commuted, since E [log (1 + ρX)] ≤ E [X] ∀ρ > 0, and consequently, the dominated convergence criterion is satisﬁed. Thus, Property 1 follows.\nLet X and Y be non-negative RVs. Using (5), ∀g ∈ T BF we can write\nfor some a, b ≥ 0 and µ(s) ≥ 0, which satisﬁes the conver- gence conditions. Commuting the expectation and integral in (13), we get\nwhere (15) follows from Property 1 and (14), since X ≤ c Y . To prove the converse, we begin with E [g(X)] ≤ E [g(Y )]\nfor g ∈ T BF. Choosing g(x) = log(1 + x), which is T BF, we get X ≤ c Y . This concludes the proof.\nLet X, Y be non-negative RVs, and g, φ : R + → R ∈ T BF. Since T BF is closed under compositions, we have φ ◦ g ∈ T BF. Now, from Property 2, for X ≤ c Y , we have E [φ ◦ g(X)] ≤ E [φ ◦ g(Y )]. Since φ ∈ T BF, this implies g(X) ≤ c g(Y ).\nTo prove the converse, consider g(X) ≤ c g(Y ) for g ∈ T BF. Choosing g(x) = x, we get X ≤ c Y , which completes the proof.\nThis property is easily seen to follow from (9) with g(x) := log(1 + x).\nThis property is proved using mathematical induction. To begin with, let φ : R → R + ∈ T BF, and X 1: M := [X 1 , . . . , X M ] have independent and non-negative RVs as components. Assume likewise for Y 1: M := [Y 1 , . . . , Y M ]. Now, for M = 1, Property 5 is true due to Property 3. Next, let us assume Property 5 to be true for vectors of length M −1. Thus, we have g(X 1: M −1 ) ≤ c g(Y 1: M −1 ). This implies\nProceeding with the proof, for vectors of length M , consider E [φ (g(X 1: M )) |X 1 = x] = E [φ (g(x, X 2: M ))] \t (17)\nwhere (18) follows from (17) due to (16). Now, taking the expectation with respect to X 1 on the left hand side of (17) and the right hand side of (18), we get E [φ (g(X 1 , . . . , X M ))] ≤ E [φ (g(Y 1 , . . . , Y M ))]. Equations (17) and (18) can be re- peated by conditioning on all the other RVs to complete the proof."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"F. Belzunce"},{"name":"M.
