For odd prime p, many families of p-ary sequences of period p n − 1 have been reported to have good correlation properties and large linear complexity [4, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 17\u201320]. Among those well-known p-ary sequence families, most of them are generated by the m-sequences and other sequences with good autocorrelation properties. For p-ary sequences with two- level autocorrelation, without using a subﬁeld constructions, there is only one general construction for any arbitrary odd prime p, which is the m-sequences. Helleseth and Gong [5] presented a construction of p-ary sequences with ideal two- level autocorrelation for any odd p, which generalized the ternary family in [7]. Henceforth, we refer to this family of sequences as Helleseth-Gong sequences. Very recently, it was shown in [2, 3] that the cross-correlation functions between m-sequence and the decimated Helleseth-Gong sequences for some decimations were three-level valued.\nIn this paper, we employ p-ary Helleseth-Gong sequences and m-sequences, which possess optimal auto-correlation property, to construct two new families of sequences of period p n − 1 with low correlation and large linear complexity. With the examination of the rank of certain quadratic forms, it is shown that the ﬁrst family of sequences has ﬁve-level nontrivial correlation property, the second one has family size p n (p n + 1)/2, and the magnitude of nontrivial correlations of both of them is upper bounded by 1 + p (n+3e)/2 .\nLet n = (2m + 1)e and p an odd prime. Throughout we denote the ﬁnite ﬁeld of order p n by F p n and its nonzero elements by F ∗ p n , and we assume α is a primitive element of\nF p n . Let q = p e . We denote F p e as F q and F p n as F q 2m+1 when convenient. Let Tr n e (x) (and, respectively, Tr e 1 (x)) be the trace mapping from F p n into the subﬁeld F p e (and, respectively, from F p e into F p ). For simplicity, we denote Tr n 1 (x) (and, respectively, Tr e 1 (x)) as Tr n (x) (and respectively, Tr e (x)).\nGiven two sequences a(t) and b(t) of period N , the periodic cross correlation between a and b at shift τ is deﬁned as\np \t . In particular, we denote the cross correlation of a with itself at shift τ by A a (τ ), which is the autocorrelation of a. A sequence a of period N is said to have an ideal two-level autocorrelation if A a (τ ) = −1 for any τ = 0 (mod N ).\nLet S be a family of M sequences of period N . The maximum correlation value of the family S is deﬁned as\nThe quadratic form over the ﬁnite ﬁeld with odd character- istic has been well analyzed in [11]. It should be noted that the rank of a quadratic form is the minimum number of variables required to represent the function under the nonsingular co- ordinate transformations. Let Q(x) be a quadratic form from F q 2m+1 to F q and B(x, y) = Q(x + y) − Q(x) − Q(y) be its associated bilinear form. Then the rank ρ of Q(x) is related to the dimension of the vector space W in F q 2m+1 , i.e.,\nLemma 1. ([5]) Let p(x) be a polynomial with coefﬁcients in F p n such that p(λx) = λp(x) for any λ ∈ F p e . Let k be a positive integer such that gcd(k, p n − 1) = 2 and k ≡ 2 (mod p e − 1). Then,\nLemma 2.

[18] Let Q(x) be a quadratic form over F q of rank ρ and deﬁne the exponential sum\nThen, for each λ ∈ F p n , |R(λ)| can take either 0 or q 2m+1− ρ 2 , where |x| means the modulus value of x.\nLemma 4. [19] Let k be a positive integer such that gcd(2m+ 1, k) = 1 and V be a subﬁeld of F q 2m+1 . Then the dimension of the vector space V over F q k is equal to that of the vector space V over F q .\nHelleseth and Gong in [5] introduced a family of p-ary sequences with ideal two-level autocorrelation.\nTheorem 1. ([5]) Let n = (2m + 1)e and let s, 1 ≤ s ≤ 2m be an integer such that gcd(s, 2m + 1) = 1. Deﬁne b 0 = 1, b i = b 2m+1−i and b is = (−1) i for i = 1, 2, · · · , m, where indices of b is are taken modulo 2m + 1. Let u 0 = b 0 /2 = (p + 1)/2 and u i = b 2i for i = 1, 2, · · · , m. Deﬁne\nThen the sequence over F p deﬁned by s(t) = Tr n (f (α t )) has an ideal two-level autocorrelation.\nStarting from the above Helleseth-Gong sequences, several decimation numbers d for which the cross correlation functions between a t = Tr n (f (α dt )) and b t = Tr n (α t ) take only three values were found in [2] and [3].\nProposition 1. [2, 3] Let d be an integer such that (q (m+1)s + 1)d ≡ 2 (mod q 2m+1 − 1) or d = 1. Let f (x) be deﬁned as in Theorem 1. The cross correlation between a t = Tr n (f (α dt )) and b t = Tr n (α t ) takes values\nIn this section, we deﬁne two families of p-ary sequences by adopting Helleseth-Gong sequences and m-sequences and examine their correlation and linear complexity properties.\nDeﬁnition 1. Let d be an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ q 2m+1 − 2. Let f (x) be deﬁned as in Theorem 1. A family of p-ary\nsequences of period p n − 1 with family size p n + 1 is deﬁned as\nt ), if 0 ≤ i ≤ p n − 1, Tr n (α t ), \t if i = p n ,\nand {η i |0 ≤ i ≤ p n − 1} is an enumeration of the elements of F p n . Specially let η p n −1 = 0.\nDeﬁnition 2. Let s be a positive integer coprime to 2m + 1 and f (x) be deﬁned as in Theorem 1. Let Γ = {1, α, · · · , α (p n −3)/2 }. A family of p-ary sequences of period p n − 1 is deﬁned as\nTheorem 2. Let A be the family of p-ary sequences deﬁned in (2). Let d be an integer such that (q (m+1)s + 1)d ≡ 2 (mod q 2m+1 − 1) or d = 1. Then the nontrivial correlation functions of the family A only takes values from the set\nTheorem 3. Let B be the family of p-ary sequences deﬁned in (3). Then B contains p n (p n +1) 2 \t sequences and all nontrivial correlation functions C b 1 ,b 2 (τ ) satisfy\nThe following propositions characterize the rank of two quadratic forms in 2m + 1 variables over F q , which is crucial for the proof of Theorems 2 and 3.\nProposition 2. Let f (x) be deﬁned as in Theorem 1. Then the rank of the quadratic form\nProof. Note that each element δ ∈ F q 2m+1 can be repre- sented in the form δ = rγ 2 where r = 1 or r is a non square in F q . From the deﬁnition of f (x), we have\nIn order to determine the rank ρ of Q(x), we need to investigate the number of y ∈ F q 2m+1 such that the associated bilinear form B(x, y) = Q(x + y) − Q(x) − Q(y) = 0 for all x ∈ F q 2m+1 , i.e.,\nDenoting ξ i = u i (1 − rγ q 2i +1 ) for simplicity, we have B(x, y) =Q(x + y) − Q(x) − Q(y)\nThus, q 2m+1−ρ is the number of the zeros of the linearized polynomial\nwhere ξ i = u i (1 − rγ q 2i +1 ). Following from the conditions that 2u 0 = b 0 , u i = b 2i for i = 1, · · · , m and gcd(s, 2m + 1) = 1 in Theorem 1,\nAs b i = b 2m+1−i and the indices of b is is taken modulo 2m + 1, one has b js = b (2m+1)−js = b (2m+1−j)s for j = m + 1, · · · , 2m. This together with b is = (−1) i for i = 1, · · · , m implies\nm if i = m + 1, 0 \t otherwise\nNote that for any y ∈ F q 2m+1 , y q 2(m+1)s = y q s . For simplicity, we denote y q (m+1)s as y q s/2 and introduce variables β i = γ q is for i = 0, 1, · · · , 2m. It should be noted that the indices of β i is taken modulo 2m + 1 and (β i ) q s = β i+1 . Thus,\nNote that all roots of the linearized polynomial L(y) are roots of the polynomial L 1 (y) = L(y) + (L(y)) q s . For the case of β 1 = β 0 , i.e., γ ∈ F q , all roots of the linearized polynomial L(y) are roots of\nIt follows from Lemma 4 that the solution space of L 1 (y) = 0 has dimension at most 2 over F q since gcd((m+1)s, 2m+1) = 1. This implies that the solution space of L(y) = 0 also has dimension at most 2 over F q . Consequently, the quadratic form Q(x) has rank at least 2m − 1 in the case of γ ∈ F q .\nwhere the coefﬁcients a i ∈ F q 2m+1 for i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Hence, all roots of the linearized polynomial L(y) are roots of the polynomial L 3 (y). It follows again from Lemma 4 that the solution space of L 3 (y) = 0 has dimension at most 4 over F q since gcd((m + 1)s, 2m + 1) = 1. This implies the solution space of L(y) = 0 has dimension at most 4 over F q .\nThus, all possible ranks of Q(x) for any δ = 1, λ ∈ F q 2m+1 take values in the set {2m + 1 − i : i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.\nThe proof of Proposition 2 is similar in spirit to that of Proposition 3, and it is omitted due to page limitation.\nProposition 3. Let f (x) be deﬁned as in Theorem 1. Then the rank of the quadratic form\nWith the preparation of Propositions 2 and 3, we can now complete the proof of Theorems 2 and 3.\nProof of Theorem 2. We abbreviate the correlation function C a i ,a j (τ ) between a i (t) and a j (t) as C i,j (τ ). We can divide the computation of C i,j (τ ) into ﬁve cases depending on different values of t, i and j.\nAs shown in Proposition 1, C i,j (τ ) = −1 or −1 ± p (n+e)/2 . 4) τ = 0, i = j = p n .\nIn this case, a i (t) turns out to be an m-sequence over F p , so it is straightforward that C i,j (τ ) = −1.\nWhen the integer d satisﬁes (q (m+1)s +1)d ≡ 2 (mod q 2m+1 − 1), it follow from Lemma 1 that\nIt is straightforward to check Q(µx) = µ 2 Q(x) for any µ ∈ F q and B(x, y) = Q(x + y) − Q(x) − Q(y) is a bilinear form on F q 2m+1 . Thus, Q(x) = Tr n e (f (x 2 ) − f (δx 2 ) + λx q (m+1)s +1) ) is a quadratic form in 2m + 1 variables over F q . By Proposition 3, the rank ρ of Q(x) for any δ = 1, λ ∈ F p n is at least 2m − 2. Then it follows from Lemma 2 that\n  \np n , \t if ρ is odd, ±p (n+e)/2 , if ρ = 2m\nIt follows from Proposition 2 that the rank ρ of Q(x) for any δ = 1, λ ∈ F p n is at least 2m−3. As a consequence of Lemma 2, we have\n  \np n , \t if ρ is odd, ±p (n+e)/2 , if ρ = 2m\nProof of Theorem 3. Let b 1 (t) and b 2 (t) be any two sequences in B deﬁned in (4). The correlation function of b 1 (t) and b 2 (t) is determined by the following three cases:\nLet b 1 (t) = Tr n f (α 2t ) + u 1 α (q (m+1)s +1)t + v 1 α t and b 2 (t) = Tr n f (α 2t ) + u 2 α (q (m+1)s +1)t + v 2 α t . It is easily veriﬁed that\nWhen δ 2 = 1 and u 1 = u 2 , Q(x) is reduced as Q(x) = Tr n e (ux q (m+1)s +1 ) with u = u 1 − u 2 = 0. The associated bilinear form of Q(x) is\nObserve that B(x, y) = 0 for all x ∈ F p n is equivalent to L(y) = u −q (m+1)s y −q (m+1)s + uy q (m+1)s = 0. Since the solution space of (L(y)) q (m+1)s = uy + u q (m+1)s y q s has dimension at most 1 over F q , it follows that the quadratic form Q(x) = Tr n e (ux q (m+1)s +1 ), u = 0, has rank either 2m or 2m + 1. Thus, by Lemma 3, we have |1 + C b 1 ,b 2 (τ )| ∈\nWhen δ 2 = 1 and u 1 = u 2 , (i.e., Q(x)=0), since v 1 +v 2 = 0 for any v 1 , v 2 ∈ Γ, it is clear that C b 1 ,b 2 (τ ) = p n −1 if v 1 = v 2 and δ = 1, and C b 1 ,b 2 (τ ) = −1 if δ = −1.\nIt sufﬁces to consider only the case b 1 (t) ∈ B 1 , b 2 (t) ∈ B 2 since C b 1 ,b 2 (τ ) = C b 2 ,b 1 (−τ ) for any two p-ary sequences b 1 (t) and b 2 (t), where x means the conjuate of x. Let b 1 (t) = Tr n f (α 2t ) + uα (q (m+1)s +1)t + vα t and b 2 (t) = Tr n wα (q (m+1)s +1)t + α t . Similarly, we have\nλx q (m+1)s +1 , λ ∈ F p n , has rank at least 2m − 1. By Lemma 3, we have |1 + C b 1 ,b 2 (τ )| ∈ {0, p n/2 , p (n+e)/2 , p (n+2e)/2 }.\nLet b 1 (t) = Tr n w 1 α (q (m+1)s +1)t + α t and b 2 (t) = Tr n w 2 α (q (m+1)s +1)t + α t . Then\nWhen w 1 − w 2 δ q (m+1)s +1 = 0, similarly as discussed in case 1), the quadratic form Q(x) has rank either 2m + 1 or 2m, and then |1 + C b 1 ,b 2 (τ )| ∈ {0, p n/2 , p (n+e)/2 }. When w 1 − w 2 δ q (m+1)s +1 = 0, in the case of δ q (m+1)s +1 = 1, C b 1 ,b 2 (τ ) takes value p n − 1 if δ = 1, or −1 otherwise; and in the case of δ q (m+1)s +1 = 1, it is direct that C b 1 ,b 2 (τ ) = −1.\nBy a straightforward application of the results in [9], we have the following theorem:\nTheorem 4. The linear span LS(a i ) of the sequences a i in the family A deﬁned in (2) is as follows:\n  \nn(m + 1), if 0 ≤ i ≤ p n − 2, nm, \t if i = p n − 1, n, \t if i = p n .\nThe linear span LS(b) of the sequences b(t) in the family B deﬁned in (4) satisﬁes:\nLS(b) = n(m + 2), if b(t) ∈ B 1 , 2n, \t if b(t) ∈ B 2 .\nSimilar to the method in [17], it is easy to show that the family A is optimal with respect to the Welch bound in term of root mean square of all nontrivial correlations, which is considered as an important performance factor in practice [13]. Theorem 5. The family A satisfy the Welch bound with equality\n[1] S. W. Golomb and G. Gong. Signal design for good correlation for wireless communication, cryptography, and radar .
