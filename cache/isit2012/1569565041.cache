Whether the classical collision models are used, that have been popular with the networking community, or the more relevant and current models that enable successful decoding in the presence of interference and that use a cross-layer view of transmission rate and access control, that are nowadays considered by the physical layer community, it is still necessary to decide which users are allowed to transmit and for how much time should they transmit so as to attain some optimality goal. In other words the so-called scheduling problem is still an important and unsolved problem despite the fact that it has been studied a great deal in the past.\nPast work on this problem includes [8] in which a cen- tralized, polynomial-time algorithm was obtained for static networks with speciﬁed link trafﬁc requirements. The formu- lation was based on mapping the network to an undirected graph and on assuming that any two links can be successfully activated simultaneously as long as they do not share common vertices on the graph. In [6], [7] N P-hardness was addressed for the problem of determining a minimum-length schedule under a given trafﬁc demand in a wireless network with SINR constraints, using respectively the protocol model and a collision-based model. In some special cases the structure of the trafﬁc demand allowed a polynomial algorithm.\nIn [2], [3] it was shown that more fundamental resource allocation problems in wireless networks with SINR con- straints, such as node and link assignment, are also N P- hard. In these problems the goal is to assign at least one time slot to each node, or link, such that the number of\ntime slots is minimized. Set-covering formulations enabled a column generation method for solving the resulting linear programming relaxations. For the minimum length scheduling problem, a column-generation-based solution method was also used in [9], which can approach an optimal solution, with the advantage of a potentially reduced complexity. In [12] the minimum-length scheduling problem was formulated as a shortest path problem on Directed Acyclic Graphs and the authors obtained suboptimal analytic characterizations.\nIn this paper we consider the scheduling problem when there is ﬁnite volumes of trafﬁc that the different users wish to transmit over the shared channel to their destinations (which may be different or one and the same). That is, we consider the multiple access or interference channel with ﬁnite trafﬁc volume that must be delivered in minimum time. Our contri- butions include new results on the combinatorial complexity of the problem, on the structure of the optimal schedule, and ﬁnally, new necessary and/or sufﬁcient conditions for optimality based on the values of the transmission rates that the users can transmit at, when these rates depend explicitly or implicitly on the set of users who are allowed to transmit simultaneously. Thus, our results contribute to the tightening of the joint use of physical and MAC layer approaches and point to practical and realistic algorithms for approximating, or precisely determining, an optimal schedule.\nWe consider a wireless network of N transmitter-receiver pairs, or links. These are associated with a vector d of trafﬁc demand, corresponding to a ﬁnite amount of backlogged data at the transmitters\u2019 queues. Scheduling a group c of these N links means that all links in c are concurrently activated, with given power each, for some positive amount of time. The minimum-length scheduling problem, amounts to determining which groups should be selected, and the duration of activating each group, such that the entire demand vector is served (i.e. the queues are emptied) in minimum time. For any group c , the effective transmit rate r i c of any link i ∈ c is directly coupled to the composition of the activation group.\nThe ﬁrst rate model that we consider, couples the links via the G channel gains matrix, whose element G ij is the channel gain between the transmitter of link i and the receiver of link j. Denoting with P i the transmission power for link i, and σ 2 the noise variance, the signal-to-interference-and-noise (SINR) ratio for link i, when group c is activated, is given by:\nUnder this model, rate is a function F of SINR, since for the transmission to be successful the SINR must exceed a threshold, which in turn is an increasing function of the rate. This is a common and familiar approach used for the AWGN channel, and by extension, an approximation in an interference environment, by assuming interference as noise (see for example [13] and the references therein). We designate this model I A . We also consider the \u201cpacket-based\u201d approach to \u201ccollision\u201d channels, where a packet is successful if and only if the SINR meets a threshold γ ∗ without regard to the number of bits in it, or its duration. Indeed, this is a popular approach in the wireless networking community for the study of the scheduling problem (e.g. [2], [3], [5], [9]) as it decouples the packet success from the transmission rate. We call this model I B .\nIn the second model we consider the rates are determined solely by the activation group cardinality. In this special case of the ﬁrst model all concurrently activated links share the same rate value. An example scenario is a system where all receivers are located at a central point, with N transmitters having the same distance (on a circle) to the center with geometric channel gain. A similar case was considered in [5]. This case is much more structured than the one in the general setting, and its properties will be detailed in the subsequent sections. Here, the rate is deﬁned using an N -dimensional rate vector r = (r 1 , . . . , r N ), with each element r i denoting the rate of group size i ∈ {1, . . . , N }. We call this model II.\nIn both models rate has the following, intuitive, property: If two links are activated concurrently their rates can not be higher than the rates of their respective individual activation. Thus, throughout the paper, we assume that rates in a group do not grow when it is augmented. We will be referring to this property as augmentation-rate monotonicity.\nIf all the link rates for all groups c (subsets of the set of links) are known, the scheduling problem accepts a linear programming (LP) formulation. Although the LP formulation does not lead to a practically feasible solution algorithm, it enables us to gain structural insights. We introduce the following notation:\nLet the link set N = {1, . . . , N } be associated with a strictly positive vector of demand d = {d 1 , . . . , d N } T . Let H denote the set of all subsets of N , excluding the empty set. The scheduling decision vector is denoted as x and each element x c denotes the time duration of group c ∈ H. Clearly, |H| = 2 N − 1. Finally, H ∗ denotes the set of groups that correspond to an optimum schedule.\nBy the following lemma, at optimum all queue demands will be met exactly (i.e. no link will be active with nothing to transmit). This is rather intuitive and has up to now been (implicitly) taken for granted (e.g., [5]). Formalizing this result\nis useful in our case, as it solidiﬁes the form of LP basic solutions to be discussed later.\nLemma 1. There exists an optimal schedule such that, before reaching the end of the time duration of a group, none of the link queues in the group is empty.\nc with activation duration t > 0, and a link i ∈ c , such that the queue size served during this time, denoted by δ i , satisﬁes the condition δ i < r i c t. Let t = δ i r\n. Consider splitting the running time t in two segments with duration t and t − t\nrespectively. In the ﬁrst segment, group c is run, and in the second segment, the reduced group c \\ {i} is run. The lemma follows from two observations. First, the served queue volume of link i in segment one remains δ i . Second, any of the links other than i is served for an overall time of t, and their rates in c \\ {i} are not worse, if not better, than those in c .\nBy Lemma 1, we arrive at the following LP formulation. Notice that since (2b) are equalities, the formulation is in the so called standard LP form, namely\nx ≥ 0. \t (2c) There are 2 N − 1 possible groups. However, we prove\nbelow that we can always construct an optimal scheduling solution using at most N groups. The result follows from the fundamental optimality theory of LP and the structure of (2).\nLemma 2. There exists an optimal scheduling solution using at most N groups, i.e., |H ∗ | ≤ N .\nProof: Formulation (2) is clearly feasible. Hence, by the fundamentals of linear programming (e.g., [11]), there exists an optimal basic solution. For any feasible basic solution, the number of positive values is no more than the number of rows N, and equals N if the solution is non-degenerated, and thus the lemma follows.\nBy Lemma 2, there is always a compact representation of optimality, thus approaching the globally optimal schedule is equivalent to selecting the N \u201cbest\u201d groups amongst the 2 N − 1. For model I B , the problem has been shown to be N P-hard [1], [3], [7]. A natural follow-up question is whether the complexity reduces for I A . Is the problem tractable if for example, the Shannon formula is used as rate function, as has been widely done in the literature? In the following, we provide a negative answer, showing that the problem is in general hard for all rates that are continuous and strictly increasing functions of the SINR.\nTheorem 3. If the rates are strictly increasing functions of the SINR, there are N P-hard instances of the minimum-length scheduling problem.\nProof: Given the triplet (N, d, F ), where F is a continu- ous strictly increasing of the SINR, the recognition version of the problem, by Lemma 2, is as follows. Are there N groups, which can be represented using an N × N matrix, such that the total time of satisfying demand d using these groups is at most a given positive number? The problem is clearly in class N P, as checking the validity of a solution (a certiﬁcate in the form of a square matrix of size N ) is straightforward. Consider a general-topology graph G = (V, E). Let N = |V|. Thus a link in the scheduling instance corresponds to a vertex in G. Let v = F −1 ( 1 N ), and u = F −1 (1) F −1 ( 1\n, i.e., F −1 (1) = vu, also note that u > 1 since F is strictly increasing. Let σ 2 = 1 u . For each edge (i, j) in the graph, set the coupling element G ij = G ji = 1. Moreover, G ii = min{v, 1.0}, i ∈ N . All other elements of the channel matrix are zero. Finally, the transmit power P i = v G\nConsider i, and any group that contains i, but not any of the adjacent vertices in G. The SINR is vu = F −1 (1), thus the rate is 1.0. If i is put into a group containing at least one adjacent vertex in G, the SINR is no more than v/( v G\n≥ 1 and u > 0. Thus the rate of i becomes strictly less than 1 N . Suppose that at optimum, a group c containing two links i and j, that are adjacent in G, has a positive amount of time duration t > 0. Note that, in G, c corresponds to at least one connected component (because i and j are adjacent). Denote by m ⊆ V the component containing i and j, and let m = | m |. Note that m ≥ 2. By the observation before, for each of the links in m , including i and j, the demand served in time t within group\nConsider splitting group c into m groups, obtained by combining c \\ m with each of the individual links in m . Each of the m groups is given time t m . For all links in m , including i and j, the rate grows from less than 1 N to 1. Because m ≤ N , t m is strictly more than enough to serve demand t N , for any link in m . The links in c \\ m , are served with the same time duration t, with rate no less than before. We then repeat the same argument for the remaining components, if necessary. In conclusion, there is an optimal scheduling solution in which the groups are formed by links corresponding to independent sets of G. At this stage, it is apparent that solving the scheduling problem provides the correct answer to the weighted fractional coloring problem [10], with the demand vector d being the weights of the vertices, and the result follows.\nTheorem 3 generalizes the observation made in [6] on the connection between fractional coloring and scheduling under the so called protocol model, which uses a conﬂict graph and disregards the channel matrix. As our result applies to any monotonically strictly increasing function F in SINR, one should not expect that the use of smooth rate functions, including even linear ones, can result in reducing complexity.\nWe next consider the complexity issue under the more structured model of cardinality-based rates (i.e. model II).\nHere we look into a special case, where the demand values are uniform. For this setting, we readily provide a closed-form scheduling solution requiring only linear time to compute, and show it is globally optimal.\nTheorem 4. For (N, d, r), let m ∗ = argmax N m =1 mr m . If all demand values are uniform and equal to d, then the N groups, {1, 2, . . . , m ∗ }, {2, 3, . . . , m ∗ + 1}, . . . {N, 1, . . . , m ∗ − 1}, each scheduled for a time duration of d m ∗ r\nProof: For all the links, the given schedule clearly meets demand d exactly. For any feasible scheduling solution (not restricted to the case in question) of length T , the total data trafﬁc demand, i ∈N d i , divided by T , gives the average data throughput. As i ∈N d i is a constant, a schedule is minimum in time if ( i ∈N d i )/T attains the maximum possible value. By the assumption in the theorem, the instantaneous data throughput of any feasible schedule can never exceed m ∗ r m ∗ . This throughput is achieved during the entire duration of the proposed solution, and the result follows.\nThe discussion here has a direct practical implication. Consider a scenario where equal demand transmitters have similar distances (and hence close-to-uniform channel gains) to their receivers, and the latter are located close to each other. For such a case, the above solution could be used to solve the minimum-length scheduling problem, fast, and thus provide a good approximate solution to the global optimum of the real problem.\nGiven that the problem in its general form is hard, we consider two basic set activation strategies that are the most simple choices in constructing a scheduling solution. In the ﬁrst, denoted by H 1 , the links are activated one at a time and so queues are emptied completely separately. That is, H 1 = {{1}, {2}, . . . , {N }}. The second denoted by H N , fol- lows the very opposite philosophy, namely, links are activated all at once, and the N -links group is served until some of the queues becomes empty. The next group consists in all the links having positive remaining demand, and so on.\nNote that both strategies produce schedules of size N , and hence represent basic solutions (extreme points of the polytope). Given N out of the 2 N − 1 groups, the computing time of the correct time share (or concluding that the N groups do not form a feasible schedule) is normally of complexity O(N 3 ) due to matrix inversion. Solutions of H 1 and H N are simpler to construct, namely, after N calls of function F , computing the H 1 schedule runs clearly in linear time, whereas for the H N schedule the computing time is of O(N 2 ).\nIntuitively, strategy H 1 is desirable, if the links, when activated with others, experience signiﬁcant rate reduction. In following condition, where r ii denotes the effective transmit rate of a link when activated alone, we quantify this notion.\nCondition 1. For any group c ∈ H, the sum of the ratios between the members\u2019 rates in c and their respective rates of being served individually, is at most 1, that is,\nThe above condition is simple in structure. Yet, it is exact in characterizing the optimality of H 1 .\nProof: Sufﬁciency: Consider the LP formulation (2), and the base matrix B for the basic solution H 1 . The inverse matrix B −1 is diagonal with diag (B −1 ) = (1/r 11 , . . . , 1/r N N ) T . For any non-basic variable x c with | c | ≥ 2, the reduced cost equals 1 − e T B −1 r c , where r c denotes the column vector corresponding to x c in (2). This cost becomes 1− i ∈ c r i c r\n, which is non-negative if Condition 1 holds. Because none of the 2 N − N − 1 non-basic variables have strictly negative reduced cost, H 1 is optimal.\nNecessity: If Condition 1 does not hold for some group c , the reduced cost of the corresponding non-basic variable is strictly negative. Moreover, for H 1 , all the basic variables have strictly positive values. Therefore the LP pivot operation of bringing in x c into the base is not degenerate, meaning that the objective function will strictly improve, and the result follows.\nTheorem 5 provides a complete answer to the optimality of H 1 . The condition consists of one inequality per group and from the proof, it is clearly not possible to reduce them.\nConsider a pair of links, and relax the necessity requirement. A simpler sufﬁcient condition to exclude the activation of both in any group can be formulated if the two links generate high interference to each other, while their rates are not signiﬁcantly affected by other simultaneous transmissions.\nCondition 2. For a pair of links i, j ∈ N , we assume the following inequality.\nTheorem 6. If Condition 2 is true, then there exists H ∗ in which i and j do not appear together in any group, that is, in optimizing the schedule, the condition is sufﬁcient for discarding any group containing both i and j.\nProof: Suppose an optimal schedule has a group c having both i and j. Without loss of generality, assume the duration of c is 1. The demands served equal r i c and r j c for the two links, respectively. By the property of augmentation-rate monotonicity, r i c ≤ r i, {i,j} and r j c ≤ r i, {i,j} , giving the following inequality.\nConsider, instead of c , two groups c \\ {j} and c \\ {i}. The rates of i and j are at least r i, N \\{j} and r j, N \\{i} , respectively. Activating the two groups for time durations r i c /r i, N \\{j} and r j c /r j, N \\{i} respectively delivers no less than r i c and r j c as served demands for i and j, hence the conclusion.\nRemark 1. Both theorems signiﬁcantly extend previous results of the optimality characterization of two links [4], [13]. In fact, for two links, H 1 is optimal if Condition 1 holds for\nFor the case of cardinality-based rates, i.e. when the input triplet is (N, d, r), the number of inequalities in Condition 1 is reduced to N . This, together with the proof of Theorem 5, lead to the following corollary.\nCorollary 7. The following condition is both sufﬁcient and necessary for the optimality of H 1 in minimum length schedul- ing with cardinality-based rates.\nThe structure of Condition 2 also simpliﬁes for model II. In addition, by augmenting the line of arguments in the proof of Theorem 6, we arrive at a sufﬁcient condition for excluding the use of any group of a speciﬁc size m.\nCorollary 8. For (N, d, r) and a given group size m ∈ [2, N ], if the following condition holds for any m < m, there is an optimal schedule that does not use any group of size m.\nLet us brieﬂy consider when it is preferable to augment a group. Intuitively, one can expect that a group should be augmented with one link, if the new resulting joint throughput, (deﬁned as the amount of data served per time unit), is higher than that of any combination of activation durations for the group and the link separately. Conversely, if it is optimal to activate group c , then the throughput of c , given by i ∈ c r i c , can not be achieved by any combined use of its | c | subsets of size | c | − 1. This insight leads to the following condition.\nc ˘ 1 , c ˘ 2 , . . . , c ˘ n its n subsets of cardinality n − 1, obtained by respectively removing from c links 1, 2, . . . , n. Denote by r c ∈ R n + the vector of rates of the links in c , and r ˘i ∈ R n + the corresponding rate vector for c ˘i (with zero rate for i). We consider the following condition, which we call condition 3: For any λ = (λ 1 , . . . , λ n ) T ∈ R n + with e T λ = 1,\nRemark 2. Note that ﬁnding whether or not there exists a λ vector that violates the condition can be formulated as an LP of size O(n), Thus the condition can be checked efﬁciently for any given group.\nWhat the above condition states is, in fact, that the rate vector of c can not be outperformed by the throughput region of the n sub-groups. If group c is active at optimum, then the condition must be true, as formulated below.\nProof: Suppose group c is activated for any positive time t. Strict inequality i ∈ c λ i r ˘i > r c in all the n ele- ments means that running c ˘ 1 , c ˘ 2 , . . . , c ˘ n , with time proportions\nλ i , i = 1, . . . , n, respectively, will serve demand tr c within less time than t, and the result follows.\nC. Optimality Conditions for Activating All Links with Positive Demand Together\nWe now turn our attention to scheduling strategy H N . In the solution, the N groups, which are easily identiﬁed, are of sizes N, N − 1, . . . , 1. Without loss of generality, assume link 1 has its queue emptied ﬁrst, followed by link 2 in the second group, and so on. Applying Theorem 9 gives immediately the following necessary condition for the optimality of H N .\nCorollary 10. If H N is optimal, then Condition 3 must be true for the N − 1 groups {1, . . . , N }, {2, . . . , N }, . . . , and {N − 1, N }.\nConsider the implication of Condition 3 for cardinality- based rates (N, d, r), i.e. model II. Because of the rate symmetry, i ∈ c λ i r ˘i can attain maximum simultaneously in all the n elements, only if λ i = 1 n for all i = 1, . . . , n. For this λ, all elements of i ∈ c λ i r ˘i equal n −1 n r n −1 , resulting in the observation below.\nCorollary 11. If H N is optimal for (N, d, r), then the following relation must hold.\nThe inequalities in the above corollary form a hierarchy of relations with a clear interpretation. Namely, if H N is optimal, then the throughput must be monotonically increasing in group size. Conversely, if this monotonicity is violated, we conclude H N is not optimal. However, the reverse formulation does not hold, i.e., the hierarchy of relations is not sufﬁcient for ensuring that H N is optimal.\nTo arrive at a sufﬁcient optimality condition for strategy H N for the general problem setting (N, d, F ), we consider maximum and minimum rates of groups. Denote by r max m\nand r min m the maximum and minimum link rates, respectively, of all groups of size m. Although the exact values of them are difﬁcult to calculate in general, in practical systems it is typically possible to derive optimistic, albeit conservative, bounds on the rates, using the function F and the channel matrix G, as replacements of the maximum and minimum values.\nCondition 4. We deﬁne the following N − 1 inequalities, with the convention that r min 0 is treated as a huge number.\nThe inequalities in Condition 4 form a chain for group sizes moving from one to N . This chain of relations is sufﬁcient for the optimality of schedule H N , namely we can show that,\nWe provide an outline, but due to space limitations we omit the proof details. For the groups in H N , we can prove that the corresponding N constraints in the LP dual are all binding.\nMoreover, one can show that the dual solution derived from these constraints together with the H N solution satisfy the complementarity slackness condition.\nWe addressed the problem of obtaining a schedule for activating subsets of N links to empty their transmitter queues in minimum time. We approached the problem introducing a modeling which provides ﬂexibility on the transmission rates used. The rate functions may vary from the asymp- totic maximum ones, approaching the capacity region, to lower achievable rates that correspond to suboptimal detector structures. We proved that the problem is N P-hard for all reasonable continuous rate functions. We obtained sufﬁcient and/or necessary conditions for optimality in a number of special cases, depending on the relative values of the rates. We have also established that the optimal schedule need not consist of more than N subset activation frames.\nIn view of the complexity result in Section IV, one can hardly expect an algorithm that is both fast and achieving global optimality under model I. Still, the closed-form result of 4, gives us a good reason to further investigate the tractability of the general case in model II. Furthermore, we are work- ing towards a broad algorithmic framework which provides ﬂexibility by a modular algorithmic design for the problem.\nThis work was supported in part by: the EU FP7 IAPP@RANPLAN Marie Curie project, ELLIIT project 1.2, CENIIT project 08.01, VR Grant B0581701, MURI grant W911NF-08-1-0238, NSF grant CCF-0728966, and ONR"},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"M.
