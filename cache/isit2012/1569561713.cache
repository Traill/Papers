This note documents our ﬁrst efforts to obtain upper bounds on optimal code sizes (for said metric) ala Delsarte\u2019s approach. For the Hamming metric, Delsarte\u2019s seminal work on powerful linear programming (LP) bounds have been extended to permutation codes, via association scheme theory. For the Kendall-tau metric, the same extension needs the more general theory of coherent conﬁgurations, whereby the optimal code size problem can be formulated as an extremely huge semideﬁnite programming (SDP) problem.

These codes have been studied in various contexts, e.g., group codes [1], signal modulation [2], [3], vector quantization [4], rank mod- ulation [5], [6], cost-constrained transpositions [7], etc. This work is motivated by a recent study on a fundamental coding problem. In [6] they looked at optimal code sizes with respect to the Kendall-tau distance metric. This metric is important to rank modulation and its applications, e.g., ﬂash memories.\nFor binary codes, Delsarte\u2019s optimization-based methods [8] give some of the best known bounds [9]. For permutation codes, we observe during initial experiments (for very small lengths) that Delsarte-like methods outperform Hamming (sphere packing) bounds [6], [10]. Our interest is to investigate, if this improvement carries over for larger codes. Tarnanen extended Delsarte\u2019s work over to permutation codes [11], however only for the Hamming metric (and other metrics with similar symmetries). The novelty here is to consider the Kendall-tau metric, and as pointed out in [6], lacks required symmetry to straight-forwardly apply Tarnanen\u2019s techniques.\nDelsarte\u2019s (and Tarnanen) techniques are based on associa- tion schemes, from which linear programming (LP) formula- tions (of the optimal code size problem) are obtained. For the Kendall-tau metric, one needs to consider the more general\ntheory of coherent conﬁgurations (CC), which instead deliver semideﬁnite programming (SDP) formulations. The matrices in these SDP\u2019s turn out to be of unwieldy size, but recent work [12], [13], [14] suggest possible approaches. One may exploit the algebraic structure of the CC\u2019s, to only work with block-diagonalized (and possibly much smaller) versions of these matrices. To our knowledge, such recent techniques are new in the area of permutation codes. However, the solution is not straight-forward. As code lengths increase, the CC\u2019s (related to the Kendall-tau metric) become huge quickly, motivating the techniques presented in this preliminary report.\nWhile we believe to be presently unable to fully exploit the power of SDP bounds, we show some initial success. We consider the dual problem (also a SDP), and use an LP to search over a subset of feasible solutions. We obtained mod- est improvement over a recently published Singleton bound in [6]. The reduced complexity allows us to compute up to permutation codes of length 11 (where the matrices were previously of order 11 factorial). Certain bottlenecks, if solved, could allow computation for longer codes. As it stands, our proposed LP bounds perform poorer than known Hamming bounds [6], and it remains to see how far sophisticated SDP- based approaches can ultimately bring us. This note aims to motivate new research to resolve this open question.\nLet S n denote the symmetric group on a set {1, 2, . . . , n} and dist(, ) be a distance metric on S n . A subset V of S n is an (n, δ min ) permutation code (with respect to dist(,)), if for any g, h ∈ V such that g = h, we have dist(g, h) ≥ δ min .\nDeﬁnition 1 (Optimal code size problem). Let dist(, ) be a distance metric on the symmetric group S n . Let δ min ≥ 1. The following problem is the optimal code size problem.\nThe image of i by g is denoted g(i). The inverse of g is denoted g − 1 . The product of permutations g and h is\ndenoted gh, whereby (gh)(i) = g(h(i)). Most literature (e.g., Tarnanen [11]) consider the Hamming metric\ndist(g, h) ∆ = #{1 ≤ x ≤ n : (g − 1 h)(i) = i}, \t (2) i.e. , the Hamming distance dist(g, h) equals the number of moved points of g − 1 h. For the direct product group S n × S n , deﬁne its action on S n , as (α, β) · g ∆ = αgβ − 1 , where (α, β) ∈ S n × S n and g ∈ S n . For any subgroup G of S n × S n , a metric dist(, ) on S n is G-invariant if for any g, h ∈ S n , we have dist(g, h) = dist((α, β) · g, (α, β) · h) for all (α, β) ∈ G. The Hamming metric (2) can be veriﬁed to be (S n × S n )-invariant.\nThe length of a permutation g, denoted length(g), equals the minimum integer r satisfying g = α 1 α 2 . . . α r whereby α i are adjacent transpositions in S n . For rank modulation [5], [6] we consider the Kendall-tau metric, given as\ndist(g, h) ∆ = length(g − 1 h). \t (3) There exists a unique element w 0 , termed the longest element, that satisﬁes length(w 0 ) = n(n − 1)/2. Then w 0 is an involution, i.e., w − 1 0 = w 0 , and dist(g, h) = dist(gw 0 , hw 0 ), see [15], p. 119. Denote a subgroup {e, w 0 } of S n by Ψ n , where e is the identity element of S n . In general, the Kendall- tau metric is (S n × Ψ n )-invariant.\nA permutation g written as g = (123) means g(1) = 2, g(2) = 3 and g(3) = 1. Note (12), (23), (13) are transposi- tions, in particular the ﬁrst two are adjacent transpositions.\nExample 1. Consider S 3 with elements e, (12), (23), (123), (132), (13), and the Hamming metric. The minimum distance between any two non-equal permutations is 2. For δ min = 1 and 2 we have µ(n, δ min ) = #S 3 . For δ min = 3 the code V with the optimal size satisﬁes V = {e, (123), (132)}. Check dist(e, (123)) = dist(e, (132)) = 3, and dist((123), (132)) = dist(e, (123) − 1 (132)) = dist(e, (123)) = 3.\nThe minimum possible non-zero Kendall-tau pairwise dis- tance is 1. For δ min = 1, we have µ(n, δ min ) = #S 3 as before. For δ min = 2 the optimal code satisﬁes V = {e, (123), (132)}. Check dist(e, (123)) = length((123)) = 2, where (123) = (12)(23). For δ min = 3 the optimal code satisﬁes V = {e, (13)}, where (13) is the longest element w 0 in S 3 and length((13)) = 3 (here (13) = (12)(23)(12)).\nWe now describe objects used to formulate relaxations of (1). For a subgroup G of S n × S n , deﬁne an induced action of G on S n × S n , as g · (x, y) ∆ = (g(x), g(y)) where g ∈ G and x, y ∈ S n . An orbit of this induced action is termed an orbital. These orbitals ∆ 1 , ∆ 2 , · · · , ∆ d of the induced action partition {(x, y) : x, y ∈ S n } = ∪ d i =1 ∆ i . If the action of G on S n is transitive, we use the convention ∆ 1 = {(x, x) : x ∈ S n }. For each orbital ∆ i , we correspond an adjacency matrix A i as follows. Here A i is a 0-1 matrix, whose rows/columns are indexed by S n , and we have (A i ) x,y = 1 if and only if (x, y) ∈ ∆ i . Let A T i denote the transposed matrix of A i .\nTheorem 1 (c.f. [16], p. 52). Let G be a group which acts on S n transitively. For the induced action of G on S n × S n , the adjacency matrices A i corresponding to the d orbitals ∆ i , satisfy\niii) for any A i , there exists some A i \u2032 that satisﬁes A T i = A i \u2032 . iv) for any i, j ∈ {1, 2, · · · , d}, there exists numbers p k ij that\nA coherent conﬁguration (CC) denoted (G, S n ), refers to the set {A 1 , A 2 , · · · , A d } of corresponding adjacency ma- trices. A CC with the additional property p k ij = p k ji is an association scheme ; in this special case, Delsarte showed how combinatorial properties can deliver linear programming (LP) bounds [8]. Construct two CC\u2019s related to the G-invariances of the Hamming and Kendall-tau metrics. For the former metric, set G = S n ×S n and call (S n ×S n , S n ) the conjugacy CC - the name comes from [11]. For the latter metric, set G = S n × Ψ n and term (S n × Ψ n , S n ) the length CC. Let R S n ×S n denote the set of real matrices and index set S n . Write A S n ,i and A Ψ n ,i for adjacency matrices of conjugacy, and length CC.\nExample 2. The matrices in R S 3 ×S 3 corresponding to the conjugacy and length CC (the indexing on S 3 is done in the same order that appears in Eg. 1), are written as follows. First A S n , 1 = A Ψ n , 1 = I, where I is the identity matrix. Next\n      \n0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0\n      \n      \n0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0\n      \nBy Theorem 1, A S n , 3 = J − I − A S n , 2 , here J has all ones. Finally, it so happens that we get A Ψ n , 3 = A S n , 3 and A Ψ n , 4 = A S n , 2 − A Ψ n , 2 . Matrices A S n , 1 to A S n , 3 corresponding to Hamming distances 0, 2, 3, and A Ψ n , 1 to A Ψ n , 4 to Kendall- tau distances 0, 1, 2, 3.\nThe focus here is on the length CC, related to the Kendall- tau metric. The conjugacy CC (related to the Hamming metric) is actually an association scheme, and is treated in [11]; the recollection is because of connections exploited later.\nA symmetric matrix M in R S n ×S n is positive semideﬁnite, if all its eigenvalues are non-negative. We now use CC\u2019s to formulate the relaxation of the optimal code size problem. By iii), Theorem 1, a set { ˜ A 1 , ˜ A 2 , · · · , ˜ A ˜ d } of symmetrized adjacency matrices are obtained, whereby ˜ d ≤ d. If A i is not symmetric, then ﬁnd A i \u2032 such that A T i = A i \u2032 , and set\n˜ A j = A i + A i \u2032 . Similarly the symmetrized orbitals ˜ ∆ i are obtained by setting ˜ ∆ j = ∆ i ∪ ∆ i \u2032 if ˜ A j = A i + A i \u2032 . Note both (g, h) and (h, g) belong to the same ˜ ∆ j , and dist(g, h) = dist(h, g). Thus by G-invariance of dist(, ) set δ j = dist(g, h) for any (g, h) ∈ ˜ ∆ j , since dist(g, h) = dist(g \u2032 , h \u2032 ) for any (g, h), (g \u2032 , h \u2032 ) ∈ ˜ ∆ j . The values δ j are called orbit-distances (with respect to a G-invariant metric dist(, )). If G acts transitively on S n , then by convention ˜ ∆ 1 = {(g, g) : g ∈ S n }, thus δ j ≥ 1 for all j ≥ 2. The properties of the CC\u2019s can simplify the following optimizations.\nDeﬁnition 2 (Primal SDP, (G, S n ) and δ min ). Let G be a group which acts on S n transitively and dist(, ) a G-invariant distance metric on S n . Let δ j be the orbit-distances w.r.t.\n(G, S n ) and dist(, ). Deﬁne the semideﬁnite programming (SDP) problem correp. to (G, S n ) and some δ min ≥ 1, as\ns.t. M is positive semideﬁnite, and Tr(M ) = 1, Tr ( ˜ A j M ) ≥ 0, for 2 ≤ j ≤ ˜ d,\nwhere ˜ A j is a corresponding symmetrized adjacency matrix, J is the all-one matrix, and Tr is the trace function.\nProposition 1. Let G be a group which acts on S n transitively and dist(, ) a G-invariant distance metric on S n . Let δ min ≥ 1. Then, the optimal objective value of (4) upper bounds the optimal objective value of (1) for dist(, ) and δ min .\nThe SDP (4) is a relaxation of the optimal code size problem (1), see [17] for the proof. The optimal value of the SDP (4) is at most #S n , as for any feasible M , we have Tr(JM ) ≤ Tr (J) = #S n . Software like SeDuMi [18] can solve SDP\u2019s.\nExample 3. Consider G = S 3 × Ψ 3 , whereby the Kendall- tau metric is G-invariant. Let ˜ ∆ 1 to ˜ ∆ 4 correspond to A Ψ n , 1 to A Ψ n , 4 (all symmetric). Using SeDuMi we solve for δ min = 1, 2 and 3, and get the optimal solutions\n6 · (A Ψ n , 1 + A Ψ n , 4 ). which correspond to optimal objective values 6, 3 and 2.\nDeﬁnition 3 (Dual problem, (G, S n ) and δ min ). Let G be a group which acts on S n transitively and dist(, ) a G-invariant distance metric on S n . Let δ j be the orbit-distances w.r.t. (G, S n ) and dist(, ). Let ˜ A j be a corresponding symmetrized adjacency matrix to (G, S n ). Let δ min ≥ 1. Deﬁne the following\nAny feasible solution b in R ˜ d to the dual program (5), provides an upper bound to the optimal objective value of the SDP (4), see [14]; we have the following chain of inequalities\nOur interest in SDP bounds is motivated by initial ex- perimentation. Table I shows optimal objective values of (5) obtained using SeDuMi, for (small) n = 3 to 5. We compare with two other bounds, i) a Singleton bound (SB) recently published in [6], and ii) a Hamming bound (HB) obtained by sphere packing, see [6]. Ball-sizes for HB were obtained from exact numbers of permutations with k inversions [10]. For cases shown, SDP bounds always perform the best, with some tightness veriﬁed by limited exhaustive searches. Given that optimization-based bounds are (some of) the best-known for binary codes, e.g. see discussion in [9], it is not unusual to ask: for permutation codes, are SDP bounds always better for all n?\nTo seek an answer we should compute for larger n, thus motivating the proposed method in the next section. When S n gets large, problems (4) and (5) become increasingly difﬁcult to solve, as the matrices ˜ A j have order #S n . Our method is inspired by recent work [12], [13], [14], which show that if ˜ A j come from a CC, then the ˜ A j can be replaced (in (4) and (5)) by block-diagonalized versions - exact details omitted here. This may result in huge complexity reduction, e.g., [14] shows how SDP\u2019s related to the conjugacy CC reduces to simpler LP problems. The caveat is that number of matrix blocks (obtained from diagonalization) is at least d, the number of adjacency matrices A i , see [12]. Unfortunately for the length CC, this number quickly becomes large for increasing n, see Table II. Thus in our case it becomes difﬁcult to directly apply the techniques in [12], and modiﬁcations of the ideas are needed.\nUsing \u201cduality\u201d we consider the feasible solutions b to (5) (for some G-invariant dist(, ) and δ min ≥ 1) that furnish upper estimates b 1 to µ(n, δ min ), see (6) and Proposition 1. While \u201cduality\u201d ideas are not new, the novelty here is to \u201cguess a good subset\u201d of feasible solutions (in the dual program) described by a manageable number of linear equations, and use an LP to optimize over them. For a CC (G, S n ), a feasible solution b corresponds to a positive semideﬁnite matrix in the following set 1\n \n \nTo build an intuition on how such a strategy is possible, we ﬁrst connect with the LP bound of the conjugacy CC (S n × S n , S n ) described in [11]. To clarify between conjugacy and length CC\u2019s, we respectively denote A S n ,i and A Ψ n ,i for adjacency matrices, and d S n and d Ψ n for their numbers.\nWe claim that the set A S n ×S n ,S n is a subset of A S n × Ψ n ,S n , seen by showing each A i to lie in A S n × Ψ n ,S n . Observe that S n × Ψ n is a subgroup of S n × S n , hence the orbitals of the length CC, lie within those of the conjugacy CC. In other words, there exists index subsets I S n ,i , where ∪ d Sn i =1 I S n ,i = {1, 2, · · · , d Ψ n }, such that A S n ,i = j∈I Sn,i A Ψ n ,j hold (for all i). The claim A S n ,i ∈ A S n × Ψ n ,S n follows if A S n ,i is a symmetric matrix, see property i) of the following theorem from [11].\nTheorem 2 (c.f. [11]). Let (S n ×S n , S n ) denote the conjugacy CC, where (S n × S n , S n ) = {A S n ,i : 1 ≤ i ≤ d S n }, and A S n , 1 = I. Then all of the following hold for A S n ,i :\nii) commutativity, i.e., A S n ,i A S n ,j = A S n ,j A S n ,i for all i, j. iii) diagonalization by an orthonormal matrix U in R S n ×S n ,\nc j = d i =1 p i,j . By convention c 1 = #S n (the only non-zero eigenvalue of J) and c j = 0 for j ≥ 2.\nThe numbers d S n , tabulated in Table II, equal the partition number of n, see [11]. Consider a matrix d Ψn j =1 b j ˜ A Ψ n ,j in A S n × Ψ n ,S n , that for some a ∈ R d Sn , can be ex- pressed as d i =1 a i A S n ,i . Theorem 2 allows us to further express d Ψn j =1 b j ˜ A Ψ n ,j = d Sn j =1 z j · (U I j U T ) where z j =\np i,j a i . Then d Ψn j =1 b j ˜ A Ψ n ,j − J is positive semideﬁnite (see (5)) if the linear constraints d Sn i =1 p i,j a i ≥ c j hold for all j, for constants c j in iii). Intuitively, Theorem 2 is an explicit \u201cdiagonalization\u201d of all matrices in the subset A S n ×S n ,S n of A S n × Ψ n ,S n , and facilitates checking of positive semidef.\nA simple extension of the \u201cdiagonalization\u201d idea to the following larger subset of matrices, works reasonably well. Property ii) of Theorem 2 implies iii), as symmetric matri- ces that commute share common eigenspaces. As such, we desire 2 a subset B of A S n × Ψ n ,S n , with the property that any M ∈ B, commutes with any M \u2032 ∈ A S n × Ψ n ,S n . Thus any two matrices in B commute. Such a subset B may be obtained\n \n \nwhere W is an orthonormal, 0-1 matrix in R S n ×S n , that sat- isﬁes (W ) x,y = 1 if and only if yw − 1 0 = x for any x, y ∈ S n . From (8) we see B contains the set A S n ×S n ,S n considered in Theorem 2. Also by the previous corresponding between B j and the orbital ∆ j (see [17]), one can check W commutes with all of A S n × Ψ n ,S n (and each A S n ,i ). Because the longest element satisﬁes w − 1 0 = w 0 , thus W T = W − 1 = W . So A S n ,i W are symmetric, and B is a set of symmetric matrices.\nOne technical lemma, that connects (8) with the dual problem (5), stands in way of ﬁnally describing our LP bound. This lemma involves a special subgroup Θ n of S n , where Θ n is also involved in a few ﬁnal deﬁnitions. Let Θ n = {α ∈ S n : (α, α) · w 0 = w 0 }, where (α, α) · w 0 is\ncomputed using the action of S n ×S n on S n . Let ˜ A Θ n ,ℓ denote the symmetrized adjacency matrices belonging to the CC (S n ×Θ n , S n ), where there are ˜ d Θ n of them. Note ˜ d Θ n ≤ d Ψ n . Lemma 1. Let A S n ,i and ˜ A Θ n ,ℓ be the symmetrized adjacency matrices belonging to the conjugacy CC and (S n × Θ n , S n ), respectively. Let W be deﬁned as before. For 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ ˜ d Θ n and 1 ≤ i ≤ 2d S n there exists 0-1 coefﬁcients t ℓ,i that satisfy\nSee [17] for proof. The coefﬁcients t ℓ,i satisfying (9) are used to state the following main theorem. For Θ n ⊆ S n , let index subsets ˜ I Θ n ,ℓ satisfy ˜ A Θ n ,ℓ = j∈ ˜ I Θn,ℓ ˜ A Ψ n ,i . Using orbit-distances δ j w.r.t. (S n × Ψ n , S n ) and the Kendall- tau metric dist(, ), deﬁne constants γ ℓ that satisfy γ ℓ = max{δ j : j ∈ ˜ I Θ n ,ℓ }.\nTheorem 3 (LP Bound on (S n × Ψ n , S n ) and δ min ). Let W be the 0-1 orthornormal matrix deﬁned as before.\nFor 1 ≤ i, j ≤ d S n , let constants p i,j , c j and matrices U, I j be obtained from Theorem 2. Let matrices M 1,j and M 2,j satisfy M 1,j = 1 2 (U I j U T )(I + W ) and M 2,j =\nFor 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ ˜ d Θ n , let the constants γ ℓ be deﬁned as above. For 1 ≤ i ≤ 2d S n , let the coefﬁcients t ℓ,i satisfy (9). Let a ∗ in R 2d Sn solve the following LP problem\nLet b ∗ 1 and µ(n, δ min ) respectively denote the optimal objective values of the dual problem (5), and the optimal code size problem (1), for G = S n × Ψ n and the Kendall-tau metric dist(, ) and δ min . Then we have the following inequalities\nAs promised our main result Theorem 3 furnishes an LP bound on the optimal code size µ(n, δ min ). See [17] for proof. The number ˜ d Θ n of matrices ˜ A Θ n ,ℓ is given in the previous Table II, where observe ˜ d Θ n > d S n , but ˜ d Θ n is much reduced from d Ψ n . Table III shows our computed LP bounds whereby n is between 3 and 11. Our proposed LP bound fails to completely answer the question posed (at the end) of Section III, but some initial success is obtained. Observe that our LP bound is at least as tight as the SB in the places highlighted in bold font. Improvements are mainly obtained when δ min is close to n(n − 1)/2. Interestingly, these two bounds are useful for similar ranges of δ min (the SB is known to be non-trivial only when δ min ≥ n, see [6]). For the case n = 3 the LP and SDP bounds are equal, though unfortunately for n > 4, our LP\nbound does worse than the HB, and the performance gap gets bigger for smaller δ min . Inspired by [6] (which points out three regions with different asymptotics), it is tempting to conjecture that different strategies work for cases δ min < n and δ min ≥ n. The subset searched here works reasonably well for the latter case, for the former what are the \u201cgood\u201d dual-feasible subsets?\nOne issue: no known efﬁcient method to compute \u201cmax. distances\u201d γ ℓ , where γ ℓ = max{δ j : j ∈ ˜ I Θ n ,ℓ }. If one replaces Θ n by S n in the expression for γ ℓ , (where A S n ,i =\nA Ψ n ,j ), then [19] has closed-forms for γ ℓ . Also its is unclear how large the number #{1 ≤ δ ℓ ≤ ˜ d Θ n : δ ℓ ≥ δ min } of non-positive constraints could be. No rigorous analysis is done here, but see [20] for a characterization of Θ n .\nMotivated by recent work on solving SDP\u2019s with algebraic structure, we formulated the optimal code size problem w.r.t. Kendall-tau metric as a SDP, and propose using LP to search for solutions. The problem seems difﬁcult, but we report modest improvement over a recent Singleton bound.\nThe interest is to progress toward (possibly) beating known Hamming bounds, for the cases n ≥ 6 (other than those shown here). We offer some future directions. As previously mentioned, it would be nice to analyze the subsets that should be searched (for δ min < n). Next, one might generalize to larger subsets where a manageable SDP (not a LP as here) is used for searching. Finally, one might seek a similar Fourier- type analysis as [9], using representation-theoretic techniques."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"D.
