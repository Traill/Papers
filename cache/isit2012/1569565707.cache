In statistical physics, Z is called a partition function. We also deal with this quantity in context of information theory [1], [2]. In both of statistical physics and information theory, we are mainly interested in the exponent of Z, i.e.,\nor equivalently F := lim N →∞ (1/N) log Z. We often assume randomness in the partition function, and consider two types of exponent, the annealed free energy lim N →∞ (1/N) log E[Z] and the quenched free energy lim N →∞ (1/N)E[log Z] where E[·] denotes the expectation. In that case, we ﬁrst consider the annealed free energy since the quenched free energy is \u2018obtained\u2019 from the annealed free energy by using the non- rigorous replica method. In order to obtain the annealed free energy, while statistical physicists have proposed various techniques, we have found that the method of types provides a general and intuitive approach [3]. For obtaining the annealed free energy in this approach, Laplace\u2019s method is used after the classiﬁcation of X N according to the types of assignments on factor graphs [4].\nIn this paper, we consider a more precise analysis of E[Z] which is exact up to a constant factor, i.e.,\nwhere C(N) is a subexponential function of N. Derivation of C (N) is the main purpose of this paper. In statistical physics\nand information theory, most of works are dedicated to the analysis of exponent (1). Two of the important exceptions are the error probability of the random codes below the critical rate [5] and the expected number of codewords of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes [6]. In both cases, the central approximation [7] is essentially used instead of Laplace\u2019s method. This paper reﬁnes our previous result [3], and shows the usefulness of the central approximation combined with the method of types for many models in statistical physics and information theory.\nLet A(a, b) be the (a, b) element of a matrix A. Let I n be the identity matrix of size n. Let A t be the transpose of A. Let |X | be the cardinality of a set X . Let Dg and D 2 g be the gradient and the Hessian matrix of a function g. Let z\nbe the L 2 norm of z. Let H(ν) denote the entropy function − ∑ x ∈ X ν (x) log ν (x) of a probability measure ν on X . The following lemmas are used in this paper.\nLemma 1 (Sylvester\u2019s determinant theorem). For n × m matrix A and m × n matrix B,\nLemma 2 (Local approximation). For a probability measure ν (x) on X satisfying ν (x) > 0 for all x ∈ X and a function\nLet X R be a ﬁnite set. In this section, without speci- fying any details, we study the following generic \u201cpartition function,\u201d which has the form of a randomness-averaged nth power of a partition function of a certain dense model:\n+ Ng 1 N\nwhere f and g are bounded continuous functions taking n and n (n + 1)/2 arguments, respectively. The function g is assumed to be invariant under permutations of the replica indices a , b, and to have a Hessian matrix. This model includes as special cases various models often studied in statistical physics and information theory, e.g., the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model [1], random matrices [8], code-division multiple-access channels [2], etc. By using the method of types, one obtains [9]\nwhere (x) is a type of length N on the alphabet X n . From Laplace\u2019s method, the exponent F := lim N →∞ (1/N) log E[Z n ] is given by\nwhere ν(x) denotes a probability measure on X n , and where a (x) ν := ∑ x∈ X n ν (x)a(x) for any function a(x). Here, we\nconsider a more detailed result on E[Z n ] of the form (2). In fact, the factor C(N) in this case does not depend on N, and is obtained via the central approximation [7].\nTheorem 3 (Central approximation for the dense model). Assume that the solution of the maximization problem (4) is unique and is denoted by ν ∗ (x). Furthermore, assume ν ∗ (x) > 0 for all x ∈ X n and\nwhere U and U are n (n + 1)/2 × n(n + 1)/2 matrices deﬁned by\nNote that if the solution of the maximization problem (4) is not unique, the constant factor is\nwhere the contributions from all solutions ν ∗ (x) of the maximization problem (4) are summed up. For the p-spin model [1], D 2 g is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are D 2 g ((a, b), (a, b)) = β 2 p 2 x (a) x (b) p−2 ν ∗ where β > 0 is the\ninverse temperature. The positive deﬁniteness of the matrix for which the determinant is taken is equivalent to the Almedia- Thouless (AT) condition [10], which is a condition for the stability of a replica symmetric (RS) solution.\nIn the replica theory, we often assume the RS assumption, i.e., ν ∗ (x) is invariant under permutations of the n variables in x ∈ X n . In this section, for simplicity, it is assumed that the alphabet is X = {+1, −1}. The matrices D 2 g , U and U can thus be reduced to n(n − 1)/2 × n(n − 1)/2 matrices since x (a) x (a) = 1 always holds. It is known that D 2 g and U − U share the same eigenspaces [10], [2]. Let A be the n(n − 1)/2 × n (n − 1)/2 matrix with elements\n  \n \nP , if |{a, b} ∩ {c, d}| = 2 Q , if |{a, b} ∩ {c, d}| = 1\nBoth U −U and D 2 g are of this form on the RS assumption. The eigenvectors of A does not depend on P, Q and R. From this observation, one obtains\n1 − 1 − q 2 + 2(n − 2)q(1 − q) + (n − 2)(n − 3) 2\nwhere P, Q and R are (5) for D 2 g and where q := x (a) x (b) ν ∗ , r := x (a) x (b) x (c) x (d) ν ∗ . In the deﬁnitions of q and r, the indices a, b, c and d are all different. In the limit n → 0, the ﬁnite-size correction term of the RS free energy E[log Z]/N is\n1 n\n1 N\n− 3 2\nwhere the variables q, r, P, Q and R are to be determined by the saddle point condition of the RS free energy [1]. For SK model where P = β 2 , Q = R = 0, in the paramagnetic phase β < 1 where q = r = 0, the ﬁnite-size correction term is (1/(4N)) log(1 − β 2 ). This result is known in [11]. For SK model, at the critical temperature β = 1, eigenvalues of the Hessian include zero. For β > 1 where the full-step replica symmetry breaking must be considered, the Hessian also includes zero eigenvalue. Hence, for β ≥ 1, the second derivative analysis is not sufﬁcient and the analysis of third or higher-order derivative is needed [7]. For β = 1, the results are partially obtained in [11].\nThe proof of Theorem 3 is the same as the ordinary proof using the saddle point method [7]. Let α ∈ (1/2, 2/3). The equations for deriving Theorem 3 are on the next page. The asymptotic equality A ∼ B means that A = B(1 + o(1)). From continuity of f and g, the assumption of unique maximum, and α > 1/2, the sum for (x) − Nν ∗ (x) > N α is asymptotically negligible [7]. From α < 2/3, the approximation in Lemma 2 and the second-order expansion of g are used in (7) and (8), respectively. In (9), the ﬁrst-order factor is removed from the optimality of {ν ∗ (x)}. In (10), the Riemann integral formula is used. In the next equality, the Gaussian integral is performed. Here, H is the |X n | × (|X n | − 1) matrix deﬁned by\n  \n−1, if x = x 0 1, \t if x = x\nfor any ﬁxed x 0 ∈ X n , B is the |X n | × |X n | diagonal matrix deﬁned by B(x, x) = 1/ν ∗ (x), and J is the |X n | × n(n + 1)/2 matrix deﬁned by J(x, (a, b)) = x (a) x (b) . One obtains Theo- rem 3 by using Sylvester\u2019s determinant theorem (Lemma 1) and the following equations, which can be veriﬁed easily\nD. Perturbation of the joint empirical distribution from the i.i.d. Boltzmann distributions\n1 N\nFor a Boltzmann distribution with an energy function E(x), the probability distribution of the joint empirical distribution is deﬁned as\nHere, we consider randomness of the energy function and the expectation of P E ({ν(z)}) with respect to it, i.e., P({ν(z)}) := E[P E ({ν(z)})]. By the replica method, it can be calculated as [1]\nAlmost the same calculation as that of E[Z n ] shows that it tends to the delta distribution on the RS assumption [1]\nwhere ν RS m (x) is the m-joint distribution determined from the RS solution. For the dense model, i.e., E[Z n ] is of the form of (3), by the same calculation as that of E[Z n ], the distribution around the expectation can be obtained from\nTheorem 4 (Central limit theorem for the dense model). It is assumed that the replica method on the RS assumption gives a correct result. On the assumption of Theorem 3, √\nN ν x m (z) − ν RS m (z) z∈ X m weakly converges to the degen- erate Gaussian distribution of zero mean and the covariance matrix (S − S)(I | X m | − JD 2 gJ t (S − S)) −1 evaluated at the RS solution.\nLet the overlaps q x ab := z (a) z (b) ν x m . As a consequence of Theorem 4, {\nverges to the Gaussian distribution of zero mean and the covariance matrix (U −U ) I m (m+1)/2 − D 2 g (U −U ) −1 . This result is known for SK model at high temperature β < 1 rigorously (without replica method nor cavity method) [12] where the covariance matrix is 1/(1−β 2 )I m (m−1)/2 . Obviously, a local limit theorem also holds although it is not explicitly stated here due to the lack of the space.\nIn this section, we deal with the random regular factor graph ensembles. The calculation of the exponent of the partition function using the method of types is proposed in [3] while the basic idea of the type of factor graph is mentioned in [4]. In this section, similarly to the previous section, the central approximation is used for deriving the constant factor.\nA factor graph is a bipartite graph consisting of variable nodes and factor nodes, deﬁning a probability distribution\nwhere a is the index of the factor nodes and where ∂ a is the set of indices of variable nodes connected to the factor node a. Let l and r be, respectively, the variable and factor node degrees of some regular factor graph ensemble. The random connection of edges is chosen uniformly from the (Nl)! possible connections. Let E[·] denote the expectation on random connection of edges. Let variable-type denote the type of variable nodes, i.e., there exists (x) variable nodes of value x ∈ X . Let factor-type u denote the type of factor nodes, in which the value of a factor node is regarded as the values of variable nodes connected to the factor node, i.e., there exists u(x) factor nodes connecting variable nodes of values x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x r . Here, the order of values is distinguished for general f (x) which is not invariant under permutations of the arguments x ∈ X r . Let N( , u) be the number of assignments\nwith variable-type and factor-type u. The partition function Z is then given in terms of types as\nIn the summation above, the types and u have to satisfy the condition for consistency\nwhere N z (x) denotes the number of z ∈ X in x ∈ X r . The expected number N( , u) of assignments with variable-type\n(Nl)! . One thus obtains the exponent as\nN log E[Z] = max\nl r\n(x) N\n(x) N\n(x) − Nν ∗ (x) N\n(x) N\n(x) − Nν ∗ (x) N\nε (x) 2 ν ∗ (x)\n1 r\nThe above maximization problem can be regarded as the minimization problem of the Bethe free energy on the averaged model [3].\nFor obtaining the constant factor, the central approximation is used similarly as in the previous section. The derivation is omitted for the lack of space. The unique difference is that the condition (11) affects the widths of rectangles in the Riemann integral formula. By leaving the product of the widths of rectangles as the unknown variable s, the following theorem is obtained.\nTheorem 5 (Central approximation for random regular factor graph ensembles). Assume that the solution of the maximiza- tion problem (12) is unique and is denoted by (ν ∗ (x), µ ∗ (x)). Furthermore, assume ν ∗ (x) > 0 for all x ∈ X , and\n, if x = x 0, \t if x = x\n1 s\nwhere F is given by (12), and where s is some integer depending on l, r and the support of f (x).\nLet S ⊆ X r be the support of f (x). In order to obtain s, the following condition for {ε(x)} x∈ S , which play the same role in the analysis as those in (9), must be considered:\n(13) where 0 and x 0 are any ﬁxed elements in X and S, respec- tively. Although we have not obtained a general result about s, there are several cases where s can easily be speciﬁed. When l is a prime, (13) deﬁnes simultaneous linear equations on the ﬁnite ﬁeld F l . Hence, s = l c where c denotes the rank of the simultaneous linear equations. When X = {0, 1}, one has s = l/g where g := gcd({N 0 (x) − N 0 (x 0 )} x∈ S \\x 0 , l). As a consequence, the asymptotic expected number of codewords of LDPC codes is obtained up to the constant factor [6].\nThe annealed version of Theorem 4 for random regular factor graph ensembles is obtained as follows.\nTheorem 6 (Central limit theorem for random regular factor graph ensembles). On the assumption of Theorem 5,\nwhere {X z } z∈ S is the degenerate Gaussian distribution of zero mean and the covariance matrix (T − T )(I | X r | − KCK t (T − T )) −1 where T is an |X r | × |X r | diagonal matrix deﬁned by T (x, x) = µ ∗ (x), where T is an |X r | × |X r | matrix deﬁned by T (x, x ) = µ ∗ (x)µ ∗ (x ), and where K is an |X r | × |X | matrix deﬁned by K (x, x) = N x (x)/r.\nFor the type of variable nodes { (x)} x ∈ X , a similar result is obtained with the covariance matrix (V −V )(I | X | −C(V − V )) −1 r /l. As mentioned in the previous section, a local limit theorem also holds. The results in this section can be gener- alized to the quenched version by using the replica method similarly to the previous section.\nThe work of RM was supported by the Grant-in-Aid for Scientiﬁc Research for JSPS Fellows (22·5936), JSPS, Japan."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"M.
