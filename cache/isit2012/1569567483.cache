This deﬁnition agrees with the \u201crule of thumb\u201d of multiplying the degrees of freedom available in space and frequency. However, while the mathematical deﬁnition requires both frequency and spatial bandwidths to scale simultaneously, a physical argument precludes such a scaling to occur in practice.

Electromagnetic signals, as functions of space and time, are characterized by both spatial and frequency degrees of freedom that can be exploited for communication. Spatial degrees of freedom have been the subject of intense investigations in the context of multiple antenna systems (MIMO) and ad-hoc wireless networks. Since the ﬁrst MIMO experiments performed at Bell Laboratories in the late nineteen nineties [1], it was clear that multiple scattering, providing signal\u2019s spatial diversity through multi-path propagation, can enhance the throughput of the system. Theoretically, it was predicted that the Shannon capacity of MIMO systems could scale linearly with the number of antennas in certain physical propagation conditions providing independence of channel gains between transmitters and receivers [2], [3]. However, it has also been pointed out that in the presence of correlated fading performance can decrease substantially [4], [5], [6]. More recently, the physical limits of the number of spatial degrees of freedom and of the information capacity of spatially distributed MIMO systems have been considered by a number of authors [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. These limits are universal, in the sense that hold in any propagation conditions and do not depend on speciﬁc assumptions on the channel gains, correlations structure, etc. The main result of all of these works is that the number of spatial degrees of freedom is physically limited by the size of the radiating system. In particular, for large radiating systems, the size of a wavelength-normalized cut enclosing all the transmitters limits the number of spatial degrees of freedom available for communication [8], [9], see Figure 1 for a pictorial representation of this limitation. The upper\nbound can theoretically be achieved in a speciﬁc scattering environment by distributing uniformly in space a large number of small cylindrical elements that provide diffusive scattering in all directions [17] 1 .\nAll of the above works refer to narrowband frequency trans- mission over a single carrier frequency channel. This paper aims at characterizing the physical limits of communication when multiple frequency channels are used. On the one hand, it seems natural to assume that in the presence of two frequen- cies, the total number of available degrees of freedom would scale as r(ω 1 +ω 2 ), because for each frequency the number of spatial degrees of freedom is proportional to the wavelength- normalized quantity r ω i , and there are two frequency channels available for transmission. On the other hand, it is natural to ask whether eventually there is a fundamental limit on the joint scaling of space and frequency that prevents the total number of degrees of freedom to continue growing as r i ω i , as both r and the number of frequency channels are increased.\nIt turns out that the nature of wireless communication prevents unbounded and simultaneous spatial and frequency diversity gains. Our argument proceeds in two steps. First, we show that a rigorous deﬁnition of the total number of degrees of freedom that coincides with the intuitive notion of taking the product of the spatial times frequency diversities can only be valid in an asymptotic sense where both r and the frequency\nbandwidth used for transmission grow simultaneously. Then we argue, using a simple theoretical model of rich multiple scattering from point obstacles radiating in all directions, that such a simultaneous scaling is not possible: an environment increasingly rich of spatial degrees of freedom necessarily leads to poor frequency diversity and vice-versa.\nIn the context of physics, the number of degrees of freedom is deﬁned as the minimum number of parameters sufﬁcient to describe the evolution of a system within a given precision. In analogy to the physical deﬁnition, a mathematical deﬁnition in the context of squre integrable signals can be given as follows. Consider the space S of L 2 signals of total energy\nGiven a level of accuracy > 0, deﬁne the number of degrees of freedom at level of the subspace B Ω ⊂ S of bandlimited signals whose amplitude spectra vanishes for |ω| < Ω as\nwhere d N (B Ω ) is the Kolmogorov n-width [18] of the space B Ω . N (B Ω ) represents the dimension of the minimal sub- space representing the elements of B Ω within accuracy in the interval (−T/2, T/2). A basic result in approximation theory (see e.g.[18, Th. 2.5]) states that\nwhere λ N is the N -th eigenvalue (arranged in non-increasing order) of the Fredholm integral equation of the second kind arising from Slepian\u2019s concentration problem [20]\nπ(t − t ) ψ n (t )dt = λ n ψ n (t), t ∈ (−T/2, T/2). (5)\nLetting N 0 = ΩT /π, we have that for n N 0 most of the eigenvalues are close to one, while for n N 0 most of them are nearly zero. As N 0 gets large, it is well known [19], [21] that the exact width of the n-interval of the transition increases as log N 0 . More precisely, for any > 0 if\nn = N 0 + O(log N 0 log(1/ )) \t (6) then we have lim N 0 →∞ λ n (N 0 ) < . It then immediately follows that according to our deﬁnition the number of degrees of freedom of bandlimited signals is\nN (B Ω ) = N 0 + O(log N 0 log 1/ ), as N 0 → ∞. (7) Notice that the dependence of the degrees of freedom from\nis weak, in the sense that it grows only as log 1/ , making the effective dimensionality of the space practically independent of the accuracy of the approximation. This is very desirable,\nas it makes the degrees of freedom a principal feature of the mathematical model of the real world of transmitted signals, that is practically insensitive to small changes of a secondary feature of the model, such as the accuracy of the measurement apparatus with which the signals are detected, see [22] for a through discussion of this point.\nThe above shows that for strictly bandlimited signals the number of degrees of freedom is essentially given by the Nyquist number N 0 = ΩT /π. When signals are not perfectly bandlimited a triangular inequality can be used [23]. Letting A ⊂ S a subspace of signals not necessarily bandlimited, we have\nNotice that, in contrast to the ﬁrst term, the second term in (8) depends on Ω. Hence, in order to bound the degree to which general signal spaces can be approximated by ﬁnite- dimensional subspaces, a typical technique is to project the space A onto B Ω and then determine the error associated to this projection. This error is then added according to (8) to the approximation error given by the Kolmogorov n-width of the corresponding bandlimited projection. We elucidate this technique in the context of electromagnetic signals below.\nThe general set-up developed in the previous section can be applied to the space E of electromagnetic signals. These are functions space and time, deﬁned in the domain provided by their initial and boundary conditions. A suitable mathe- matical representation is the L 2 space of square-integrable functions, so that they admit a Fourier spectral representation. Occasionally, the space E can be extended to include Dirac δ-distributions to model, for example, idealized concentrated sources, such as point charges and line currents.\nThe electric ﬁeld on the whole space-time is represented by superposition of angular frequency components as\nIt follows that we can deﬁne the natural space-time (r, t) domain, the partial spectral space-frequency (r, ω) and wavenumber-time (k, t) domains, and the full spectral wavenumber-frequency (k, ω) domain. The ﬁeld representa- tions in these domains are e(r, t), E(r, ω), e(k, t), E(k, ω).\nE (w, ω) 6\n? \t -  - \nOn the circular cut in Figure 1 the space-frequency ﬁeld E (r, ω) can also be represented as E(s, ω), using a scalar arc-length coordinate s normalized to the radius r. Hence, the Fourier transform pairs linking the four ﬁeld representations are in this case the ones depicted in Figure 2.\nFor any given angular frequency ω, since the ﬁeld E(s, ω) is observed over a ﬁnite interval for s ∈ (−π, π), its space- Fourier transform E(w, ω) must have an unbounded support in the variable w. Let us consider the bandlimitation error in terms of deviation D B W from the space B W of functions of bounded support W . According to the deﬁnition given in (9) we have\nA main result of [23] ensures that, in absence of scatterers external to the cut, letting W 0 = ωr/c, the bandlimitation error D B W (E ) is close to one for W \t W 0 and close to zero for W W 0 . The exact width of the W -interval of the transition increases sublinearly as W 1/3 0 . More precisely, for any > 0 if\nWe can now apply the general set-up developed in section II to determine the number of spatial degrees of freedom of the ﬁeld. We have the Fourier transform pair\nE (s, ω) ↔ E(w, ω), \t (16) that is space-limited to the interval s ∈ (−π, π) and almost bandlimited to the interval w ∈ (−W 0 , W 0 ). Using (8) with the change of variables A → E , Ω → W , we can ensure that the Kolmogorov n-width d n (E ) < , by ensuring that both D B W (E ) and d n (B W ) are less than /2. This can be done by ﬁrst choosing W as in (15) so that D B W (E ) can be arbitrarily small as W 0 = (ωr/c) → ∞. Then, letting N = (W 2π)/π and N 0 = (W 0 2π)/π we choose\nso that d n (B W ) can also be made arbitrarily small as N 0 = (2πrω/c) → ∞. We conclude that letting the wavelength- normalized size of the circular cut tend to inﬁnity, (17) corresponds to the number of spatial degrees of freedom N (E ) of the ﬁeld. This result was determined in [23], [24] in the context of electromagnetics and in [8], [9] in the context of information theory. In addition, in [8, Sec. III-B] it has been shown that this number of degrees of freedom does not increase in the presence of scattering objects placed outside the cut-set. The argument essentially being that the external scatterers do not add new spatial channels because the circular cut already captures all ﬁeld paths coming out of the sources.\nWhen instead of a single angular frequency ω transmission occurs over a range of frequencies Ω, an asymptotic notion of total number of space-frequency degrees of freedom can be introduced that relies on the same concentration arguments given for the single-dimensional case. Let U, S be two mea- surable sets in R 2 and consider the subspaces of signals whose natural (s, t) domain is supported in U and those whose full spectral (w, ω) domain is supported in S. These will play the role of the timelimited and bandlimited signals considered in Section II, extended here to two-dimensional sets in space- time and wavenumber-frequency. We let\nThe total number of space-frequency degrees of freedom is related to the total bandwidth in the (w, ω) domain, so we need to determine to what extend this total bandwidth concentrates around the support S.\nLet Ω 0 = rΩ for any ﬁxed Ω = |ω M − ω m | > 0, and W 0 = rW for any ﬁxed W = ω m /c. Let S be the rectangle Ω 0 × W 0 and U be the rectangle 2π × T .\nTheorem 1. The total number of degrees of freedom at level of the space of ﬁelds E is bounded as\nProof sketch: The proof requires setting up the ap- propriate eigenvalue equation analogous to (5), and showing that concentration can occur by scaling both dimensions of (either one) of the two sets S and U simultaneously. Letting T U and B S be orthogonal projections onto T (U ) and B(S) respectively, it is not too hard to show that the generalization of equation of (5) to the case at hand is given by the operator equation\nwhere the eigenfunctions ψ n ∈ T (U) are mutually orthogonal and complete, and the eigenvalues measure their concentra- tions in S. By a result in [25, Th. 2], letting S = rQ for ﬁxed Q and r → ∞, the number of eigenvalues above scales as\nthe product of the measures m(U ) times m(S) = r 2 m(Q). In our context, letting Q = Ω × W , this means\nA few remarks are in order. We have shown that in order to obtain a scaling of the total number of degrees of free- dom as the product of the frequency times the wavenumber bandwidths, one needs to scale the two bands at the same rate. This can be accomplished by scaling the radius of the radiating system, so that the wavenumber bandwidth concen- trates at the scale of the radius as shown in Section III-A, and simultaneously scaling the frequency bandwidth at the same rate. For the careful reader, an important point of the proof that requires some attention and might not be evident from the sketch presented above, is that since the wavenumber bandwidth depends on the frequency ω, the domain S is really a trapezoid. Having chosen to scale the bandwidth W 0 corresponding to the smallest frequency ω m , we discarded the right-most and left-most triangles of the trapezoid so that S becomes a rectangle. This, of course, does not change the scaling behavior of the result.\nGiven the mathematical results outlined above, it is of interest to ask whether it is physically possible to have a joint scaling of the frequency and the wavenumber bandwidths so that the upper bound in Theorem 1 is achievable. The work in [17] shows that the largest amount of spatial diversity occurs in an environment where small scattering elements diffuse the electromagnetic ﬁeld uniformly in all directions. Next, we use a simple multiple scattering model of wave propagation developed in [26], [27] to show that in the case of a uniform distribution of point scatterers that radiate uniformly in all directions, the frequency diversity decreases with increasing clutter. Thus, there appears to be a trade-off between the spatial diversity provided by a cluttered environment and the cut-off of the high frequency bands due to the spreading behavior of the diffusive channel.\nIn [26] a simple model of multiple scattering based on the theory of random walks has been proposed. The model has been successively reﬁned in [27] to study propagation of impulse waveforms in cluttered environments and it has been shown capable to closely track real electromagnetic pulse propagation data. The model considers successive random reﬂections of photons in the environment. The photons are initially concentrated at the source and then spread in the environment following random trajectories, see Figure 3. At each collision with an obstacle, a photon can be absorbed with probability α, or scattered uniformly in a random di- rection with probability (1 − α). For the postulated uniform distribution of scatterers, the photon\u2019s path length in between\nsuccessive collisions is an exponential random variable of parameter η indicating the density of obstacles per unit length, so that 1/η is the mean inter-obstacle distance.\nIn ([27, Eq. 12-13]) an expression for the response to an arbitrary impulse waveform is obtained. This can be easily adapted to obtain the response to a δ-impulse. The obtained impulse response, averaged over all travelled paths of total length R given by the sum of the successive steps of the walk, and valid for t > r/c, is given by\nFigures 4 and 5 show plots of the impulse response (23) for α = 1. Larger spreads are observed for increasing values of η and r. This suggests that the spreading nature of the channel, providing richer multi-path spatial diversity, also eventually works as a low-pass frequency ﬁlter decreasing the frequency diversity.\nTaking the Fourier transform of (23), expanding the expo- nential function in a Taylor series around R 2 − r 2 = 0, and integrating term by term changing the integration variable to u = R/r and using the integral in [28, identity 3.387.3], we obtain that the expected transfer function H(r, ω) is given by\nwhere H 1 = e −r(η+jω/c) 2πr , K n (·) is the modiﬁed Bessel function of the second kind of order n and Γ(·) is the Gamma function. Using some known asymptotic expansions of Bessel functions, the sum can be evaluated as ηr → ∞, leading to the following ﬁnal result.\nTheorem 2.
