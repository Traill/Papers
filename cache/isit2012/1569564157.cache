Recently a new approach called interference alignment (IA), ﬁrst introduced by Maddah-Ali et.al. in [1], shows that by restricting all inter- ference at every receiver into a small space a higher degree-of- freedom (DoF) than traditional methods can be achieved. After [1], researchers have made a series of signiﬁcant progress [2- 8] that can be categorized into 2 types: signal scale alignment and signal space alignment. The former schemes are motivated by deterministic network models [2][3] or the results from number theory [4]. And the latter tries to align interference in signal space through linear pre-coding at transmitters and combining operations at receivers [5-8]. Compared with the former, the signal space alignment methods are more appli- cable and stimulate higher interest because beam-forming and zero-forcing (needed in the latter) are of much less complexity than lattice coding and minimum distance decoding (needed in the former). In the following discussion we only care about the latter scheme.\nThough so many progresses have been made, IA is still far from being applicable in practical systems. That is partly because most of current IA research progresses are obtained in Gaussian interference channel and X channel which are different with practical cellular networks. In [8] Suh and Tse have proposed a alignment scheme called subspace alignment which is applicable to single antenna cellular network. How- ever, their scheme depends on the property of single antenna system that the channel matrix between antennas can be decomposed into Kronecker product of smaller matrices, and will meet difﬁculties when applied in multi-antenna systems because this property no longer holds. Another reason is the required number of dimensions (number of antennas or amount of time/frequency extensions) of IA is very large. That is because to align interference at all receivers sufﬁcient channel diversity is required [6]. And this requirement can\nonly be satisﬁed by encoding between a huge number (usually increase exponentially with the number of transmitters in the network) of independent fading time/frequency extensions or antennas. However, practical systems only have limited channel diversity.\nIn this paper, the designing of IA for cellular networks is discussed. Our target is to ﬁnd an IA scheme which does not depend on the special structure of channels. In the other hand, we draw the idea of relay-aided alignment [7] in the design. Relay is used to receive signals from all transmitters in every time slot, then scale and forward the received signal during the next slot. Due to the additional diversity introduced by relay, the required symbol extensions can be reduced and the designing of IA is simpliﬁed signiﬁcantly. Finally we got an enhanced relay-aided IA (eRIA) scheme. The \u201cenhanced\u201d is reﬂected in the fact that compared with [7], our scheme has a wider range of application. Though we only discuss the designing of eRIA in MIMO cellular network in this paper, actually eRIA also can be applied to other transmission models such as GIC and X-channel. And we will also show that eRIA has a better performance than Suh and Tse\u2019s scheme in the following discussion through theoretical analyze and empirical simulation. Higher DoF per cell can achieved and less time extensions are needed. Speciﬁcally, the time extensions needed to set up IA can be reduced to merely K + 1 where K is the number of users.\nNotation : span(X), rank(X), vec(X) denotes the column space, rank, vector obtained by stacking the columns of matrix X respectively. dim(X) is the dimension of vector space X.

Consider a multi-cell cellular network operating in a rich- scattering quasi-static ﬂat fading environment. In more detail, rich-scattering means fading coefﬁcients between antennas are\nassumed to be drawn i.i.d. from a continuous distribution. And quasi-static means channel fading is constant during the trans- mission. In this network there are C base stations (BS) with N antennas, KC user equipments (UE) with M antennas and a relay with N r receive antennas and M r transmit antennas. In this paper, the uplink and downlink transmission of multi- cell cellular network is modeled as interfering multiple access channel (IMAC) and interfering broadcast channel (IBC) [8] respectively. During the following discussion, we use ˜ H, ˆ H and H to denote the channel fading between UE k, and relay, relay and BS c, UE k and BS c respectively. And subscripts are used to indicate the transmission direction. For example, ˜ H r,k means the fading experienced during the transmission from UE k to relay, k = 1, 2, · · · , KC. And H c,k is the channel matrix of the link from UE k to BS c, c = 1, 2, · · · , C.\nIn uplink transmission demonstrated in Fig.1(a), UE k sends d independent data streams m k ∈ C d×1 along direction V k ∈ C M T ×d during a period of T time slots, i.e.\nwhere x k (t) ∈ C M ×1 is the signal sent during the t-th time slot. The transmit power across all UEs is assumed to be same and allocated uniformly among data streams. Signal received at relay in time slot t is given by y r (t) =\n˜ H r,k x k (t) + n r (t). n r (t) denotes the local noise at relay. The relay scales the received signal in the (t − 1)-th time slot with coefﬁcients G t−1 ∈ C M r ×N r and forwards the scaled signal during the t-th time slot, i.e. x r (t) = G t−1 y r (t − 1). BS c listens to the signal from the UEs that belong to set µ(c) {k|(c − 1)K < k ≤ cK} and treats signals from other UEs as interference. Received signal at BS c during the t-th time slot can be represented by\n(1) where n c (t) = ˆ H c,r G t−1 n r (t − 1) + n c (t), n c (t) denotes local Gaussian noise at BS c. Here we deﬁne x k (0) = 0 M ×1 and n r (0) = 0 N r ×1 to avoid the cumbersome declaration of boundary conditions. Then (1) can be easily rewritten as\n    \n    \nIn downlink transmission model IBC, shown in Fig.1(b), BS c broadcasts messages {m k ∈ C d×1 |k ∈ µ(c)} along the\ncorresponding directions {V k ∈ C N T ×d |k ∈ µ(c)} to UEs. And each UE only detects the intended d data strams sent from its service BS β(k), β(k) \t k K , and treats signals from other BSs as interference. By the similar derivation as that in IMAC and switching UE index and BS index we can obtain the received signal at UE k as:\nClearly, (3) is close to (2) for IMAC. Moreover reference [8] introduced a duality principle between IMAC and IBC. Hence the following derived DOF and designing of eRIA related to IMAC can be directly applied to IBC. The related derivations in IBC are not shown in this paper due to space limitation. In the next section, we ﬁrst discuss the eRIA design in MIMO IMAC when BSs and UEs have same number of antennas, i.e. M = N . Then results of section III will be extended to the M = N scenarios in section IV.\nIn this section, we show the detail eRIA design in IMAC and derive the achievable DoF. We focus on how to realize IA by designing {G t }. And pre-coding matrices {V k } are ﬁxed to simplify the operation at transmitters. As we shall see, the computational and implementation difﬁculty are reduced compared with conventional IA schemes.\nFrom the model deﬁned in the previous section, it is straightforward to derive the alignment conditions of MIMO IMAC. Obviously, at BS c interference will at least occupy d dimensions because each UE sends d independent data streams. So the best we can do in MIMO IMAC, demonstrated\nin Fig.2(a), is to align all K(C − 1) interference signals into the same d-D subspace at all BSs. i.e.\nMeanwhile, to separate aligned interference from intended signal at the receiver, we should guarantee that the intended signal and the interference are linear independent. Then we have\n(5) Let\u2019s explain (5). The ﬁrst dK columns of S c are the basis\nvectors of intended signal space and the last d columns denote the basis of interference. k can be arbitrarily chosen as long as k / ∈ µ(c) since all inerference are aligned. Basis vectors of UE k will exactly span the whole interference subspace. Note there is a constraint condition d(K + 1) ≤ M T hidden in (5).\n(4) and (5) just are the alignment conditions of IMAC. If (4)(5) hold, the received signal at the BS c spans a d(K + 1)- D space. And only d dimensions are occupied by aligned interference no matter how many interference sources there are. By projecting the received signal onto the subspace orthogonal to interference dK interference-free dimensions are obtained. Then dK T DoF per cell is achievable. The achievable DoF is maximized when T = d(K+1) M :\nIn this subsection we discuss how to satisfy (4) and (5) by designing scaling coefﬁcients {G t } at relay. Before the discussion, we need to decide several important parameters. First we let d = M and T = K + 1 To obtain the maximum achievable DoF. Further we ﬁx pre-coding matrices at UEs as V k = 1 (K+1)×1 ⊗ V, ∀k where V is arbitrary M -D non-singular complex matrix. We also arbitrarily choose a\ngroup of M K-d non-singular matrices F c = [F c,i,j ] K×K , c = 1, 2, · · · , C. F c,i,j ∈ C M ×M . The role of {F c } will be seen in the following discussion.\n1) Sufﬁcient Condition of (4): Before answering the ques- tion how to align all interference at all BSs, we try to answer a easier question: How to align 2 signals at BS c? If we can ﬁnd the way to align 2 signals then the alignment of any number of signals can be done by traversing all combinations of 2 UEs and 1 BS. The following theorem gives the sufﬁcient condition of alignment for 2 UEs:\nTheorem 1. At the BS c, signal from UE k and UE k will be aligned, i.e. span( ¯ H c,k V k ) = span( ¯ H c,k V k ), if\nwhere B c,k \t ˜ H r,k H −1 c,k . Note that the deﬁnition of B c,k implies the non-singularity of H c,k which holds a.s. for the rich-scattering assumption.\nProof: Using the deﬁnition of ¯ H c,k and V k we have ¯ H c,k V k =\n   \n   \n   \n   \n(8) Substitute (7) into (8) we have\nwhich indicates that any column of ¯ H c,k V k can be expressed as a linear combination of columns of ¯ H c,k V k , Similarly we also can prove columns of ¯ H c,k V k can be expressed by columns of ¯ H c,k V k . i.e. span( ¯ H c,k V k ) = span( ¯ H c,k V k ).\nNow back to (4). There are K(C − 1) − 1 equations need to be satisﬁed in (4) to align K(C − 1) interference signals at BS c. Each equation can be rewritten as a group of M 2 K equations according to theorem 1. Traversing all C BSs we obtain the sufﬁcient condition of (4) which consists of M 2 KC(KC − K − 1) equations:\n2) Sufﬁcient Condition of (5): We perform elementary transform to S c as follows: Right-multiplying the i-th block of M columns with matrix (H c,i+(c−1)K V) −1 , i = 1, 2, · · · , K, and the right-most block with (H c,k V) −1 . Followed by putting the right-most block of M columns on the left-most and subtract it from the rest blocks. Finally we use the M -D identity matrix on the upper-left to eliminate the rest elements in the left-most block of M columns. We have\nNote that rank(S c ) = M (K + 1) if and only if sub-matrix S c on the lower-right has a rank of M K. Obviously, S c will be is non-singular if we let S c = F c ,∀c. Hence we have\nwhich is the sufﬁcient condition of (5). Combining (10),(12) and using the property of Kronecker product we have\n0 M 2 ×1 , \t ∀k / ∈ µ(c) ∪ {k } vec(F c,t,k−(c−1)K ), ∀k ∈ µ(c)\nObviously, {G t } satisfying (4), (5) can be obtained by solving (13). For the sake of completeness, we summarize the deriva- tion above in following algorithm to calculate {G t }:\n1) choose d = M , T = K + 1. Choose {F c }. Set BS counter c = 0, UE counter k = 0.\n2) c = c + 1. Go to 4) if c > C, else arbitrarily choose UE index k / ∈ µ(c) and go to 3).\n3) k = k + 1. Set k = 0 and go to 2) if k > CK , else list an equation as:\n0 M 2 ×1 , \t if k / ∈ µ(c) vec(F c,t,k−(c−1)K ), if k ∈ µ(c)\n4) Calculate {G t } by solving all listed equations jointly. Finish the algorithm.\nHowever, in the above derivation we do not guarantee that (13) does have solution. To ensure the existence of solutions, the number of variables in equations, i.e. the number of elements in {G t } which equals to KN r M r , must be no less than the number of equations. This intuition is veriﬁed by the following theorem. It shows we can always ﬁnd G t satisfying IA condition (4) and (5) as long as the number of transmitter and receiver antennas at relay is sufﬁcient large.\nand b is the column vector consisting of the corresponding components at the right side of (13). Note that A and its augmented matrix [A, b] have same rank if A has full row rank. Then (17) deﬁnitely has solution. Hence we only need to prove A has full row rank to show (17) has solution.\nWith the rice-scattering assumption and condition (16), we have rank(D c ) = min(M (KC − 1), N r ) = M (KC − 1) a.s., i.e. D c has full row rank, ∀c. Using the mixed product property of Kronecker product A can be rewritten by\nwhere ˆ H \t [I N r ⊗ ˆ H T 1,r , · · · , I N r ⊗ ˆ H T C,r ] T . By switching rows, ˆ H can be transformed to I N r ⊗[ ˆ H T 1,r , · · · , ˆ H T C,r ] T . Note that [ ˆ H T 1,r , · · · , ˆ H T C,r ] T has a rank of min(M C, M r ) = M C a.s. If (15) holds. So we have\nHence I M ) ˆ H has full row rank a.s. which indicates that rank(A) = rank( C c=1 (D T c ⊗ I M )). Thus we have:\nFrom (19), we can conclude that A has full row rank and (13) has solutions a.s. if M r and N r satisﬁes the condition of (15)(16) respectively.\nas a rough approximation of DoF per cell where R Σ is the maximum achievable sum rate of all intended transmission links between UEs and BSs in eRIA. From Fig.3, we can see that the gap between Φ and the theoretical DoF (6)is marginal and vanishes to zero as ρ increases.\nNext we provide some simulation results to compare the e- RIA performance with Suh\u2019s subspace alignment performance over K-user C-cell SISO IMAC. The achievable DOF of\neRIA are stable and have nothing to do with C. It is very different to Suh\u2019s scheme, which can achieve \t K ( C−1 √ K+1) C−1 DoF. From Fig.4(a), we can see that when C = 2, two schemes have the same achievable DoF. However, when C > 2, eRIA can achieve strictly higher DoF than subspace alignment. From Fig.4(b), we can see that eRIA need only K + 1 extensions for aligning. Yet the required extension of subspace alignment will increase as K or C increases, in particular,\nK + 1) C−1 . When C > 2, eRIA requires strictly less extensions than subspace alignment. And the the gap in both DoF and extensions between eRIA and Suh\u2019s scheme will widen as C increases.\nIn the above section, we have shown the design of eRIA for IMAC when M = N . Now we extend the above results to the case of M = N . Here we deﬁne R \t max M,N min M,N .\nFirstly, we show the implementation of eRIA in the case of M > N . Here R = M N . At the UE, RN antennas are selected to cluster R antenna groups. Each group has N antennas. Then mute the rest M − RN antennas. We assume the receiving process between the different groups is independent. Thus each UE equipped with M antennas can be treated as R UEs with N antennas. Further, the original system is transformed to KR-user C-cell N × N IMAC. Hence we can using (6) to derive the DoF when M > N as:\nThe similar idea is adopted in the case of M < N . Here R = N M . At each BS, N antennas are clustered into R groups and mute the rest N − M R antennas. Further we disable the cooperation between groups. Then we assume that there are additional R K R − K dummy UEs in every cell. These dummy UEs operates like other normal UEs but they doesn\u2019t transmit anything. So they will not cause interference. Similarly, we divide these R K R UEs into R groups. Signals from the r-th group of UEs are treated as intended signal at the r-th group of antennas of corresponding BS, On the other hand, these signals are treated as interference at the other groups. Thus, K-user C-cell IMAC is transformed to R K R - user RC-cell M × M IMAC. Similarly, using (6) we can derive the DOF of M R K R R K\nnote that we introduce R K R − K additional dummy UEs per cell in the above derivation. These dummy UEs actually don\u2019t transmit any information. Hence DoF belong to them should be subtracted from the result. Thus, the DoF when M < N is derived as:\nCombining (6), (21) and (20) we have the main result of this paper. By eRIA, a DoF of\nIn this paper, we propose a relay-aided interference align- ment scheme for MIMO cellular networks. Interference align- ment in uplink transmission are considered.
