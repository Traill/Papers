Our DoF results in this regime are obtained through a novel \u201cgenie chains\u201d approach, which is the main contribution of this work. It is a chain of mappings from genie signals provided to a receiver to the exposed signal spaces at that receiver, which then serve as the genie signals for the next receiver in the chain, until an acceptable genie with the required number of dimensions is obtained, essentially converting an information theoretic problem into a linear algebra problem."},"body":{"text":"The information theoretic degrees of freedom (DoF) charac- terization of MIMO interference networks is a key objective in the quest for understanding the mathematical nature of spatial signal dimensions. Starting with the DoF characterization for the 2 user arbitrary MIMO interference channel [5], inter- mediate successes along this path have included the K user symmetric MIMO setting [6], the K user SIMO and MISO set- tings and their spatially scaled versions [1], the K user semi- symmetric MIMO setting with sufﬁciently large number of users relative to the number of antennas [2], and most recently the 3 user semi-symmetric MIMO interference channel [3]. The DoF characterization for the 3 user setting in particular, comprised of a piece-wise linear mapping with inﬁnitely many linear intervals over the range of the parameter γ (the ratio of numbers of transmit antennas and receiver antennas per user), sheds light on several interesting elements such as redundant dimensions, decomposability, subspace alignment chains and feasibility of linear interference alignment. However, it is not clear if the insights from the 3 user setting generalize to more than 3 users. Indeed, as we show in this work, the 3 user setting represents more of an exception than a rule in many aspects. As we ﬁnd out here, the DoF characterization for the K = 4 user setting, which is in sharp contrast with the K = 3 setting, is actually representative of all network size values, K > 4, as well.\nConsider a fully connected K user MIMO interference channel where there are M T and M R antennas at each transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX), respectively, each TX sending one independent message to its desired RX. Denote by H [ ji] the M R × M T channel matrix from TX i to RX j where i, j ∈ K {1, · · · , K}. For simplicity, we assume that the channel coefﬁcients are independently drawn from continuous distributions. While our results are valid regardless of whether the channel coefﬁcients are constant or varying in time/frequency, we assume the channels are constant in the exposition. Global channel knowledge is assumed to be available at all nodes.\nAt time index t ∈ Z + , TX i sends a complex-valued M T ×1 signal vector X [ i] (t), which satisﬁes an average power constraint 1 T T t=1 E[ X [ i] (t) 2 ] ≤ ρ for T channel uses. At the receiver side, RX j observes an M R × 1 signal vector Y [ j] (t) at time index t, which is given by:\nwhere Z [ j] (t) is an M R ×1 column vector representing the i.i.d. circularly symmetric complex additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) at RX j, each entry of which is an i.i.d. Gaussian random variable with zero-mean and unit-variance.\nLet R k (ρ) = R(ρ) denote the symmetric achievable rate of each user where ρ is referred to as the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). We deﬁne d(K, M T , M R ) \t lim ρ→∞ R(ρ)/ log ρ as the symmetric DoF per user. Here, the user index k is interpreted modulo K so that, e.g., User 1 is the same as User K +1, etc. The dependence on K, M T , M R may be dropped for compact notation when no ambiguity would be caused.\nNotations: We use A to denote a matrix or column vector. Also, we use A or A to represent the |A| dimensional space spanned by its column vectors where |A| is the number of columns in A. For two subspaces A, B, we denote by A\\ B = A ∩ (A ∩ B) c the intersection of A with the null space of A ∩ B. Moreover, we use o(x) to represent any function f(x) such that lim x→∞ f(x)/x = 0. Furthermore, we deﬁne M = min(M T , M R ), N = max(M T , M R ).\nTheorem 1: For the K ≥ 4 user M T × M R MIMO in- terference channel where each transmitter has M T and each\nwhere 1(·) is the indicator function, f(K, M, N) is a piece- wise linear function given by\n⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩\nNote that the DoF value for M N ∈ ( K−1 K(K−2) , K−2 K 2 −3K+1 ) is not included in Theorem 1, and is generally unknown except for a special set of cases which has a measure zero in this interval, as shown in [4]. However, for general M N ∈ ( K−1 K(K−2) , K−2 K 2 −3K+1 ) we have the following conjecture.\nConjecture 1: For the interference network deﬁned in The- orem 1, if M N ∈ ( K−1 K(K−2) , K−2 K 2 −3K+1 ), then the DoF value per user is given by d = MN M+N .\nRemark: For the regime M N ≤ K−1 K(K−2) , the information theoretic DoF outer bound is simply the cooperation outer bound [5] combined with a redundancy argument similar to the three-user MIMO interference channel that we have shown in [3]. For the remaining region M N ≥ K−1 K(K−2) , since the achievability has already been shown in [1], [2], we will focus on the DoF outer bound characterization, which is the main contribution of this work. Due to the space limitation, in this paper we will focus primarily on the K = 4 case with M T ≤ M R to present the main ideas. The DoF for the rest of settings follow from a relatively straightforward extension based on the same ideas, and thus deferred to the full paper [4].\nAccording to the results shown in Theorem 1, we show the DoF values per user normalized by N , denoted as d/N , versus the ratio γ = M/N in Fig. 1. It can be seen that the value of d/N is a function of γ. Speciﬁcally, M N = K−1 K(K−2) is a threshold ratio. If M N ≤ K−1 K(K−2) , the DoF curve is piecewise linear depending on M and N alternately. Intuitively, it means that there are antenna redundancies at either transmitter or receiver sides except for M N = 1 K and \t K K 2 −K−1 where\nthere are no antenna redundancies. Similar to [3] the DoF achievability is based on linear schemes without or with ﬁnite number of symbol extensions, i.e., asymptotical alignment is unnecessary. As shown in [8], the system is identiﬁed as proper if and only if d ≤ (M + N )/(K + 1). The threshold between proper and improper systems is shown in red in Fig.1. We will refer to this as the linear (outer) bound.\nOn the other hand, for M N ≥ K−2 K K −3K+1 and an inﬁnitely many points in ( K−1 K(K−2) , K−2 K K −3K+1 ), the value of MN M+N DoF is achievable by decomposing antennas at both transmitter and receiver sides and then using the asymptotic alignment scheme of [6] (CJ scheme) within the rational dimensions framework, as formulated in [2]. For brevity, we label the function M N/(M +N ), the decomposition DoF (inner) bound in green. Fig. 1 shows that whenever the decomposition (inner) bound is larger than the linear (outer) bound, then decomposition bound is also the information theoretic optimal DoF value. As a side note, this is an important observation that we ﬁnd to be true in other contexts as well (e.g., X networks, albeit with only one-sided decomposition in general).\nFor the conference paper, our focus is on conveying the intuition and a shorthand notation style is chosen mainly for compactness while deliberately sacriﬁcing mathematical rigor on many aspects which will be addressed with due diligence in the full paper. To illustrate our shorthand notation, consider a transmitter, equipped with M antennas, subject to a power constraint ρ, which sends a different realization of the (column) vector variable X = {x 1 , · · · , x M } over each channel use, for a total of n channel uses, in order to communicate a message at rate R. The overall transmission is indicated as X n . Let Z n be additive white Gaussian noise, say, i.i.d. with zero mean and unit variance. If H(X n + Z n ) is the differential entropy of X n + Z n , then we use the h(·) function as h(X) = H(X n + Z n ) n log(ρ) and refer to h(·) simply as an entropy function. Further, we suppress o(1) terms, i.e., terms that approach 0 as ﬁrst n and then ρ approaches inﬁnity. Note that the bounded variance noise terms are inconsequential in our notation (as they are for DoF calculations), so that h(X + Z ) = h(X) for any bounded variance AWGN Z . Also note that following the rules of our notation, we write h(X) = d, the DoF value associated with this transmitter.\nWe will regard X, within each channel use, as an M di- mensional vector space, with M signaling dimensions aligned along the natural basis. Clearly h(X) ≤ M , by which we mean,\nn log(ρ) ≤ M + o(1). We will be particularly interested in vector subspaces L of the vector space X, denoted as L ⊂ X. Let L={l 1 , · · · , l |L| } denote an |L| dimensional subspace of X, which implies that L consists of |L| linearly independent equations in the M variables comprising X. Each l i represents a linearly independent equation, which is given by X T L i where the column vector L i contains the coefﬁcients for the i th linear equation. The vectors L i will be regarded as the bases vectors for L ⊂ X. If L i may be regarded as generic vectors, then we say that L is a generic subspace. With a\nlittle abuse of notations, we use L to indicate both the set of equations, as well as the vector space spanned by its basis.\nA list of some easy to prove properties is provided next, both to familiarize the reader with our compact notation and as a reference point for subsequent technical arguments.\n(2) h(AL) = h(L)+ | det(A)| n log(ρ) = h(L) for any ﬁxed invertible matrix A. Note that we dropped o(1) terms.\n(3) For generic subspaces L [1] , L [2] ⊂ X with |L [1] | + |L [2] | ≥ M, we have the following statements:\nThe meaning of these properties should be intuitively clear. For example, property (2) states that the entropy of a vector space is independent of the basis chosen to represent it. 3a) simply states that the M variables X can be reconstructed from generic sets of linear equations as long as the total number of equations is at least M . The statement of 3b) is also easily veriﬁed, because adding h(L [2] ) to each side of the equation gives us h(X) on each side.\nHere we will focus on K = 4 and M/N > K−1 K(K−2) = 3/8. Our goal is to show the information theoretic DoF outer bound d ≤ MN M+N . We will propose a systematic approach, labeled the\u201cgenie chains\u201d approach, based on four central ideas. To keep the presentation intuitive and compact, we need additional terminology, speciﬁcally the notion of exposed subspaces and some notations for generic subspaces and the interference subspaces available to a receiver after decoding and removing its desired signals.\nExposed Subspace: An exposed subspace, e.g., from TX1 at RX2, denoted as X [1 ∼2] refers to the linear equations containing only X [1] variables, that are obtained at RX2 after subtracting all desired signal variables (for RX2 this would be X [2] ), and zero forcing (i.e., projecting into the null space, or simply using Gaussian elimination to remove) the other interferers (in this case X [3] , X [4] ). For example, consider the exposed space X [1 ∼2] in the ( M, N ) = (2, 5) setting. At RX2, after removing desired signals X [2] , we have 5 equations in 6 variables X [1] , X [3] , X [4] (Since M = 2, each X [ k] represents 2 variables). Eliminating 4 variables, X [3] , X [4] , leaves us with 1 equation in the two variables X [1] . This remaining linear equation, containing only variables X [1] is the exposed space from TX1 at RX2, i.e., X [1 ∼2] . The dimensionality of the exposed space may be indicated with a subscript, e.g., X [1 ∼2] 1\nGeneric Subspace: The notion of a generic subspace has been deﬁned previously. Here we introduce only the notation. We use X [ k] ( m) to denote an m-dimensional generic subspace of the M -dimensional vector space X [ k] . Basically, X [ k] ( m) consists of m random linear combinations of the M variables comprising X [ k] .\nInterference Subspace: We use the notation S [ k] to refer to the received signal at RX k, after the desired variables X [ k]\nare set to zero. This is meaningful because the receiver is always guaranteed to be able to reliably decode, and therefore subtract out, its desired signals, leaving it with a view of only the interference subspace from which it may attempt to resolve undesired signal dimensions.\nThe starting point of our outer bound is the common principle of providing a receiver enough additional linear combinations of transmitted symbols to allow it to resolve all of the interferers, so that subject to noise distortion (which is inconsequential for DoF), it can decode all messages. In general, because we are proving a converse, which means that we start with a reliable coding scheme, a receiver is already guaranteed to reliably decode its desired message, which also allows the receiver to subtract its desired symbols from its received signal. Now, the question remains whether the receiver can decode all messages. With N receive antennas, and 3 M > N undesired symbols, we have fewer equations and more unknowns, so that resolution of symbols is not guaranteed. So, we provide 3 M − N genie dimensions, i.e., |G|=3M−N independent linear combinations of interference symbols. This provides the receiver enough equations to re- solve all transmitted symbols. Equivalently, the undesired X [ i] are now invertible (within noise distortion) from the receiver\u2019s own observations combined with the genie dimensions. Since noise distortion is irrelevant for DoF arguments, the ability to resolve all symbols is equivalent to the ability to decode all symbols for DoF purposes. This forms the general basis for the outer bound, and is so far not a novel concept at all.\nThe challenging aspect, and where the novelty of our approach comes in, is to determine which genie dimensions to provide so that a useful DoF outer bound results. We propose a series of steps where we continue to cycle through various receivers in a chain of genie aided outer bounds containing entropies of various vector subspaces, following 4 basic principles, that lead us eventually to a cancelation of all subspace entropy terms, producing the desired outer bound. The 4 basic principles of the \u201cgenie chain\u201d approach are highlighted next through the simplest examples.\nIdea 1: Use the exposed space from one receiver as a genie for the next.\nIn this example, |G| = 3M − N = 1, so we need to provide a 1 dimensional genie. Suppose we start with the generic subspace X [1] (1) as the genie for RX 2. Since this genie allows the receiver to decode all messages, we have the Fano\u2019s inequality:\nNote that the exposed space has appeared as a negative entropy term. As a rule, in our approach, the negative entropy terms will become the genie signals for the subsequent bounds, leading to their eventual cancellation. Also, we will use a total of M bounds. In this case, M = 2, so we move to our ﬁnal bound, and to the next receiver, RX 3. The genie, as just mentioned, will be the previous negative entropy term X [1 ∼2] 1 . The resulting bound is the following:\n⇒ 4d ≤ 5 + h(X [1 ∼2] 1 ) \t (5) Adding up the two inequalities (4) and (5), we obtain the\nRemark: The (M, N ) = (2, 5) example is perhaps a bit serendipitous because the size of the exposed space exactly matches the required size of the genie at the next receiver. In general, the two will not be the same, and we need to create either a bigger or a smaller genie. How to achieve a larger or smaller genie is the subject of the remaining three ideas.\nIdea 2: Obtain a larger genie by exposing more dimen- sions.\nIn this example, |G| = 3M −N = 2 so we need 2 genie dimensions, but N − 2M = 1, so the exposed space, e.g., X [1 ∼2] is only 1 dimensional. Similar to Example 1, we start with a generic genie at RX 2 G 1 = X [1] (2) , which is trivially linearly independent with X [1 ∼2] 1 . Thus, we have:\nFor the next bound, we move to RX 3. We will use the genie corresponding to the previous negative entropy term, X [1 ∼2] 1 , but since this is only one dimensional and we need 2 genie dimensions, we will complement it with a random dimension from the next transmitter, X [2] (1) .\nThe most important element here is how a new dimension gets exposed. RX 3 originally has one exposed dimension from TX 2, X [2] . However, when the genie provides X [1 ∼2] 1 , it exposes one additional dimension from TX 2, so that the new exposed space from TX 2 is denoted as X [2 ∼3] 2 .\nNow, with the additional exposed dimension, the exposed space X [2 ∼3] 2 \t is two-dimensional and matches the desired size of the genie. This gives us our third, and ﬁnal, bound as we cyclically move on to the next receiver, RX 4, with the genie G 3 = X [2 ∼3] 2 . Since the channel coefﬁcients associated with RX 4 are generic, the one dimensional observation available at RX 4 from TX 2 is linear independent with G 3 . Thus, RX 4 can decode all messages, and we have\nAdding up (7), (11), (12) produces the desired DoF bound 12d ≤ 21 + 2d ⇒ d ≤ 21/10. \t (13)\nIn the following we provide an alternative proof for this example to shed light on the following idea.\nIdea 3: Combine exposed subspaces from multiple re- ceivers to create a larger genie.\nAfter obtaining (7) at RX 2, similarly if a genie provides to RX 3 two random linear combination of X [1] , i.e, G 2 = X [1] (2) , we can have another inequality at RX 3:\nwhere X [1 ∼3] 1 \t is the exposed one dimensional observation available at RX 3 projecting from TX 1.\nFinally, a genie provides G 3 = {X [1 ∼2] 1 , X [1 ∼3] 1 } to RX 4 where G 3 is linearly independent with the 7 dimensional space after RX 4 removes its desired signal. Thus, RX 4 can decode all messages as well. So we have:\nStarting with a generic genie G 1 = X [1] (1) at RX 2, we have the ﬁrst inequality:\nNow, the required size of the genie is |G| = 3M −N = 1 and exposed spaces have size 2. How to create a smaller genie? We will do that by creating multiple exposed spaces, each of which may be too big to be an acceptable genie, but their intersection will turn out to be an acceptable genie.\nA genie provides to RX 3 another random linear combina- tion of X [1] , i.e, G 2 = X [1] (1) , so that we have\nwhere O = X [1 ∼3] 2 \t is the original two dimensional exposed space of TX 1 at RX 3. Since the construction of O = X [1 ∼2] 2\nand O only involve the channel coefﬁcients associated with their own receivers, they are generic and have only 2+2 −3 = 1 dimensional intersection, denoted as I = O ∩ O . Thus, we\nwhere (23) is obtained because I is included in O, and (25) follows from that {O, O \\ I} contributes d DoF. We call the\ninequality (25) the \u201cintermediate bound\u201d which is constructed by intersecting two subspaces at different receivers.\nFinally, we should provide the observations we obtain in the last step as the genie to RX 4, i.e., G 3 = I. Since G 3 only involves the channel coefﬁcients associated with RX 2 and 3, it is linearly independent with the original two dimensional observations from TX 1 at RX 4. Thus, RX 4 can decode all messages, and we have the last inequality:\nThe three examples above show that our goal is to use a chain of arguments, where we start with the exposed spaces and continue to build new genies with more dimensions by peeling off overlaps, or less dimensions by taking intersec- tions, until we have the genie of the correct size, which requires exactly M steps, and produces the bound d ≤ MN M+N , if all genies in this process are acceptable, i.e., linearly independent of the space already available to the receivers.\nNext, we will sketch the outlines of the general proofs through three speciﬁc algorithms for M/N ∈ [3/8, 1]. Due to the space limitation, we only present the algorithm for the M/N ∈ [1/2, 1] setting next. The algorithms for the other two intervals M/N ∈ [2/5, 1/2) and [3/8, 2/5) can be similarly constructed based on the 4 ideas highlighted in the paper, and we defer them to [4]. Therefore, we covers the entire region where decomposable inner bound is DoF optimal.\nSince N − 2M ≤ 0, each receiver cannot directly obtain exposed subspaces from any interferer by zero forcing the signals from the other two interferers. For brevity we let M 0 = N −M where M 0 is a positive integer. Also, note that the random linear combinations provided by a genie in each step are generic, although we may use the same notations.\nAlgorithm 1: (M/N ∈ [1/2, 1]) \u2022 Step 1:\nM 0 random linear combinations from TX k − 1. In the absence of the interference from TX k + 1, RX k has M 0 dimensional observations from TX k−1, denoted as O. This process produces the ﬁrst sum DoF inequality 4d ≤ N + 2d − h(O).\nIf |O| = |G| − M = M − M 0 , go to Step 3. If |O| < |G| − M = M − M 0 , go to Step 4. If |O| > |G| − M = M − M 0 , go to Step 5.\nA genie provides to RX k+1 the set G = {X [ k+2] , O}. Note that in the absence of interference from TX k+2 and after zero-forcing the interference from TX k+3, RX k+ 1 originally has M 0 dimensional observations of TX k, denoted as O , which combined with the |O| dimensional\nobservations from TX k, released by O, allows RX k+1 to recover the signal from TX k. This process produces one sum DoF inequality 4 d ≤ N + d + h(O). Adding up all inequalities that we have so far produces the desired bound. Then we stop.\nA genie provides G = {X [ k+2] , O, X [ k] ( M−M 0 −|O|) } to RX k+1. In the absence of interference from TX k + 2, RX k+1 originally has M 0 dimensional observations of TX k, denoted as O . Since providing O to RX k + 1 releases other M 0 observations of TX k, which is denoted as ¯ O, RX k + 1 has a total of | ¯ O| + M 0 dimensional observations of X [ k] . This process produces the inequality 4d ≤ N + d + h(O) + d − h( ¯ O, O ). Now we update O = { ¯ O, O } and k = k + 1. Go back to Step 2.\nA genie provides G={O, X [ k] (2 M−M 0 −|O|) } to RX k+1. In the N dimensional space S [ k+1] , after zero-forcing the interference from TX k−2, we still have N −M = M 0 observations of the interference from TX k −1 and TX k. After providing O to RX k +1, we continue to zero force the remaining M −|O| dimensional observations of X [ k−1] , thus only leaving M 0 −(M−|O|) dimensional ob- servations of X [ k] , denoted as O . Note that O is linearly independent with X [ k] (2 M−M 0 −|O|) provided by the genie, and they together contribute a total of d DoF. This process produces the inequality 4 d ≤ N +h(O)+d−h(O ). Now we update O = O and k = k + 1. Go back to Step 2.\nFinally, adding up all the inequalities that we have produces the desired DoF outer bound.\nRemark: Note that we do not need the intermediate DoF outer bound in this case. In contrast, for M/N ∈ [2/5, 1/2) and [3 /8, 2/5) cases the intermediate bound is necessary, as we have shown in Example 3.\nAcknowledgment: This work is supported in part by NSF CCF 1143982, NSF CCF 0830809 and by ONR N00014-12-"},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"T.
