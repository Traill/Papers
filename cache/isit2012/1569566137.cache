The three nodes in this so- called Y-channel, communicate with each other in a bi-directional manner via the relay. Studying this setup is important due to its being an important milestone for characterizing the capacity of larger networks. A transmit strategy for the Gaussian Y-channel is proposed, which mimics a previously considered scheme for the deterministic approximation of the Y-channel. Namely, a scheme which uses nested-lattice codes and lattice alignment is used, to perform network coding.

This setup consists of two nodes which act as transmitters and receivers in the same time, and its capacity is not known in general. By combining relaying and multi-way commu- nications, we obtain the so-called multi-way relay channel. For instance, the two-way relay channel (or the bi-directional relay channel) consists of two nodes communicating with each other in both directions, via a relay. This setup was introduced in [2] and later studied in [3]\u2013[6] leading to an approximate characterization of the capacity region of the Gaussian case.\nThe multi-way relay channel with more nodes was also studied in [7] in a multicast scenario. In [8], the common-rate capacity of the Gaussian multi-way relay channel, where each user multi-casts a message to all other users, was obtained by using the so-called \u2018functional decode-and-forward\u2019. A broadcast variant of this multi-way relaying setup, the so called Y-channel, was considered in [9]. Each user in the Y-channel sends two independent messages, one to each other user. [9] considered the multiple-input multiple-output Y-channel. Namely, 3 MIMO nodes communicate via a MIMO relay. A transmission scheme exploiting signal space alignment [10], [11] was proposed, and its corresponding achievable degrees of freedom were calculated. In [12], it was shown that if the relay has more than ⌈3M/2⌉ antennas where M is the number of antennas at the other nodes, then the cut-set bound is asymptotically achievable, thus characterizing the degrees of freedom of the MIMO Y-channel under this condition.\nWe consider the single antenna Gaussian Y-channel. This case is not covered in [12], and as it turns out, the statement in [12] does not apply here. In fact, it was shown in [13] that further bounds (other than the cut-set bounds) are required to\ncharacterize the degrees of freedom of the single antenna Y- channel. Thus, in the single antenna case, the cut-set bounds are not asymptotically achievable. From this point of view, it is worth to study the capacity of the SISO Y-channel as a separate problem.\nIn this paper, we propose a transmission scheme for the Gaussian Y-channel which utilizes nested-lattice codes in a functional decode-and-forward fashion, and derive its achiev- able rate region. It turns out that this scheme achieves the capacity region of the Y-channel within a constant gap.To this end, the system model is given in section II. A toy example illustrating our scheme for the deterministic Y-channel is given in Section III. The transmit strategy for the Gaussian Y-channel is described in Section IV and we conclude with section V.\nThe Y-channel is the multi-way relaying setup shown in Fig. 1. Each user U k sends a message to each other user via the relay. A code for the Y-channel, an achievable rate tuple R = (R 12 , R 13 , R 21 , R 23 , R 31 , R 32 ), and the 6-dimensional capacity region is deﬁned in the classical information theoretic sense (see [13], [14]). In our Gaussian Y-channel (GYC), the variables are real valued. The relay receives\nin time instant i, where z ri is a realization of an independent and identically distributed Gaussian noise with zero mean and unit variance (i.i.d. N (0, 1)) and h 1 , h 2 , h 3 ∈ R are the channel coefﬁcients from the users to the relay. Without loss of generality, we assume that h 2 1 ≥ h 2 2 ≥ h 2 3 . The received\n] ≤ P , and 1 n n i=1 E[X 2 ji ] ≤ P . Here, n is the length of the code. To illustrate our achievable scheme for the GYC, we start by considering a toy example for the linear-shift deterministic [15] Y-channel (DYC) deﬁned in [14].\nIn this section, we describe brieﬂy the network coding based scheme in [14] by considering the following toy example. In the DYC, we distinguish between three different patterns of information ﬂow as follows:\nb) Bi-directional: where R jk and R kj are both non-zero for some j, k ∈ {1, 2, 3}, j = k.\nc) Cyclic: where R jk , R kl , and R lj are non-zero while R kj = R lk = R jl = 0 for distinct j, k, l ∈ {1, 2, 3}.\nConsider the DYC shown in Fig. 2. The received signal at the relay is given here by the mod 2 sum of the bits arriving at each level. Let us choose the following rate tuple R = (0, 2, 2, 1, 0, 2), and see how our scheme achieves this rate tuple. It can easily be checked, that the schemes used in the bi-directional relay channel [5] (only cases b and u above) do not sufﬁce to achieve this rate tuple.\nWe write R = R b + R c + R u , where R b = (0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1), R c = (0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1), and R u = (0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0). Notice that R b resembles bi-directional information ﬂow between U 2 and U 3 with a rate of 1 bit per channel use in each direction. To achieve this rate tuple, let U 2 send one bit b 23 on relay level 1 in the uplink, and let U 3 also send 1 bit b 32 on the same level (Fig. 2). Thus, the relay receives b 23 ⊕ b 32 on level 1. The relay then forwards b 23 ⊕ b 32 on the highest level in the downlink (Fig. 3). Upon receiving b 23 ⊕b 32 , U 2 and U 3 are able to extract their desired bits, b 32 and b 23 , respectively, which achieves R b . We call this strategy the bi-directional strategy.\nThe rate tuple R c resembles cyclic information ﬂow, where U 1 , U 2 , and U 3 want to send 1 bit each c 13 , c 21 , and c 32 to\nU 3 , U 1 and U 2 , respectively, thus forming the cycle 1 → 3 → 2 → 1. Here, we use a cyclic strategy as follows. Let U 1 send c 13 on both relay levels 2 and 3, U 2 send c 21 on relay level 3, and U 3 send c 32 on relay level 2. The relay thus receives c 13 ⊕ c 32 and c 13 ⊕ c 21 on levels 2 and 3, respectively (Fig. 2). It then forwards these sums on levels 3 and 4 (3). Each receiver receives c 13 ⊕ c 21 and c 13 ⊕ c 32 , and by adding them up, it can construct c 32 ⊕ c 21 . Then, given its transmitted bit, each receiver is able to calculate the other two bits of the cyclic information ﬂow, which achieves R c .\nFinally, R u can be easily achieved using a uni-directional strategy. Here, U 1 and U 2 send one bit each, u 13 and u 21 , to levels 5 and 4 at the relay, respectively (Fig. 2). The relay forwards these bits on levels 2 and 5, respectively, and users U 1 and U 3 are then able to recover both desired bits. This achieves R u and consequently, we have achieved the rate tuple R.\nThe given scheme consumed all the levels at the relay to achieve R (see Fig. 2 and 3). If we replace the cyclic strategy, which uses 2 levels at the relay for communicating 3 bits, by the uni-directional strategy, then we do not leave enough levels free to achieve R u . This shows the importance of the cyclic strategy. Finally, we note that it was shown in [14] that the given scheme achieves the capacity region of the DYC. In the next section, we extend this scheme to the Gaussian case, with the aid of nested-lattice codes.\nWe adapt the scheme in Section III to the Gaussian case. Namely, we utilize network coding realized with lattice codes [16] to mimic the DYC scheme. We start with a brief intro- duction on lattice codes, before proceeding to describe the achievable scheme.\nA lattice Λ with n-dimensions is a subset of R n , where λ 1 , λ 2 ∈ Λ ⇒ λ 1 + λ 2 ∈ Λ. The fundamental Voronoi of Λ, V(Λ), is the Voronoi region around the origin. Nested-lattice codes are constructed using two lattices, a coarse lattice Λ c and a ﬁne lattice Λ f where Λ c ⊂ Λ f . We denote a nested- lattice code by the pair (Λ f , Λ c ), where the codewords are chosen as the points λ f ∈ Λ f ∩ V(Λ c ). The power and the rate of such code is deﬁned by Λ c and by the size of the set\nΛ f ∩ V(Λ c ), respectively. In the sequel, we are going to need the following result from [6].\nAssume that two nodes A and B, with messages m A and m B , respectively, want to exchange these messages via a relay node. The two nodes use the same nested-lattice codebook (Λ f , Λ c ) with power P , and rate R to encode their messages to x n k = (λ k − d k ) mod Λ c , k ∈ {A, B}, where λ A , λ B ∈ Λ f ∩ V(Λ c ), d A and d B are n-dimensional dither vectors uniformely distributed over V(Λ c ) [17], known at all nodes. The relay receives y n R = x n A + x n B + z n R where z n R is an i.i.d. N (0, σ 2 ) noise. Let C(x) = (1/2) log(1 + x), and C + (x) = max{0, C(x)}.\nLemma 1 ( [6]). The relay can decode the sum (λ A + λ B ) mod Λ c from y n R reliably as long as R ≤ C + P σ 2 − 1 2 . Moreover, node A knowing (λ A + λ B ) mod Λ c and λ A can extract λ B and hence also m B .\nNow, we proceed with describing the transmission scheme. In the uplink, U i splits each message m ij into three parts:\n\u2022 a bi-directional message m b ij with rate R b ij , \u2022 a cyclic message m c ij with rate R c ij , and\nThus, we have R ij = R b ij +R c ij +R u ij . The messages m b ij , m c ij and m u ij are communicated using a bi-directional, a cyclic, and a uni-directional strategy, respectively. The rates of the messages satisfy R b 12 = R b 21 , R b 13 = R b 31 , R b 23 = R b 32 , R c 12 =\n1) Encoding bi-directional messages: The users use nested- lattices to encode the bi-directional messages. Let us consider the bi-directional communication between users 1 and 2, i.e., the messages m b 12 and m b 21 . U 2 uses a nested-lattice code (Λ b 21 , Λ b 21 ,c ). The rate of the code is R b 21 and the power is P b 21 . The message m b 21 is mapped into λ b 21 . U 1 uses a scaled version of (Λ b 21 , Λ b 21 ,c ) to encode m b 12 such that the bi-directional signals align at the relay. That is, U 1 uses (Λ b 12 , Λ b 12 ,c ) =\nΛ b 21 , Λ b 21 ,c , for encoding m b 12 to λ b 12 . Using this encoding, the rate of the nested-lattice code (Λ b 12 , Λ b 12 ,c ) is R b 12 = R b 21 , its power P b 12 satisﬁes\nwhich is a useful property as we shall see in Section IV-B5. Then, U 1 and U 2 construct the signals b n 12 and b n 21 as follows,\nwith i = j, i, j ∈ {1, 2}, where d b ij is a random dither, uniformly distributed over V(Λ b ij,c ), known at all nodes (see [6]). Similarly, m b 31 and m b 13 are encoded into b n 31 and b n 13 with powers P b 31 and P b 31 , respectively, and m b 32 and m b 23 into b n 32 and b n 23 with powers P b 32 and P b 23 , where\n2) Encoding cyclic messages: Consider m c 12 , m c 23 and m c 31 (all with rate R c 123 ) constituting the cycle 1 → 2 → 3 → 1. To communicate these messages, U 1 and U 3 encode m c 12 and\nd c 31 ) mod Λ c 31 ,c using nested-lattice codes (Λ c 12 , Λ c 12 ,c ) and (Λ c 31 , Λ c 31 ,c ) with powers P c 12 and P c 31 , respectively.\nNow, U 2 sends m c 23 encoded in two different signals: one signal aligned with λ c 12 , and one signal aligned with λ c 31 . This mimics the scheme used for the cyclic messages in the the DYC (Section III). Alignment is guaranteed using the nested- lattice construction, in a similar way as for the bi-directional messages (Section IV-B1). Namely, U 2 maps m c 23 to c n 23 = (λ c 23 − d c 23 ) mod Λ c 23 ,c and ˜ c n 23 = (˜ λ c 23 − ˜ d c 23 ) mod ˜ Λ c 23 ,c , using nested-lattice codes (Λ c 23 , Λ c 23 ,c ) = h 1 h\n(˜ Λ c 23 , ˜ Λ c 23 ,c ) = h 3 h 2 (Λ c 31 , Λ c 31 ,c ) with powers P c 23 and ˜ P c 23 , respectively, such that\nNotice that this ensures alignment of the codes (Λ c 23 , Λ c 23 ,c ) and (Λ c 12 , Λ c 12 ,c ), as well as (Λ c 31 , Λ c 31 ,c ) and (˜ Λ c 23 , ˜ Λ c 23 ,c ) at the relay, allowing the relay to decode (h 1 λ c 12 + h 2 λ c 23 ) mod h 2 Λ c 23 ,c and (h 2 ˜ λ c 23 + h 3 λ c 31 ) mod h 3 Λ c 31 ,c as we shall see in Section IV-B5. The messages of the other cycle 1 → 3 → 2 → 1 are encoded similarly, to c n 13 = (λ c 13 − d c 13 ) mod Λ c 13 ,c , ˜ c c 13 = (˜ λ c 13 − ˜ d c 13 ) mod ˜ Λ c 13 ,c , c n 32 = (λ c 32 − d c 32 ) mod Λ c 32 ,c , c n 21 = (λ c 21 − d c 21 ) mod Λ c 21 ,c with powers P c 13 , ˜ P c 13 , P c 32 , and P c 21 , respectively, such that (Λ c 13 , Λ c 13 ,c ) =\n3) Encoding uni-directional messages: The uni-directional message m u ij with rate R u ij is encoded using a Gaussian code. Namely, m u ij is mapped u n ij , an i.i.d. N (0, P u ij ) sequence.\n4) Transmit signals: Each user then transmits the superpo- sition of all its codewords. For instance, U 1 sends\nSince each node has a power constraint P , then we must have P b 12 + P b 13 + P c 12 + P c 13 + ˜ P c 13 + P u 12 + P u 13 = P 1 ≤ P (5) P b 21 + P b 23 + P c 21 + P c 23 + ˜ P c 23 + P u 21 + P u 23 = P 2 ≤ P (6)\n5) Decoding at the relay: The relay decodes the uni- directional signals u n 12 , u n 13 , u n 21 , and u n 23 ﬁrst, successively in the given order while treating all the remaining signals as noise. The effective noise power while decoding u n 12 is given by h 2 3 P 3 + h 2 2 P 2 + h 2 1 (P 1 − P u 12 ) + 1. Then, reliable decoding of u n 12 is possible under the rate constraint\nAfter decoding u n 12 and subtracting its contribution from the received signal at the relay, the other signals u n 13 , u n 21 , and\nu n 23 are decoded. Reliable decoding is possible if (8)-(10) are satisﬁed.\nUsing (1)-(4), we can write the remaining noise variance as σ 2 + 2h 2 2 (P b 21 + P c 23 + P c 21 ) where σ 2 = 1 + h 2 3 (2P b 31 + 2P b 32 + 2P c 31 + 2P c 32 + P u 31 + P u 32 ). Next, the relay decodes the superposition (h 2 λ c 21 + h 1 ˜ λ c 13 ) mod h 2 Λ c 21 ,c (which is possible since this quantity belongs to the nested lattice code (h 2 Λ c 21 , h 2 Λ c 21 ,c )), then (h 1 λ c 12 + h 2 λ c 23 ) mod h 2 Λ c 23 ,c after- wards and then (h 1 λ b 12 + h 2 λ b 21 ) mod h 2 Λ b 21 ,c successively in this order using successive compute-and-forward [18] while treating the remaining interference as noise. From Lemma 1, the decoding of these signals is possible reliably as long as\n1 2\nNext, the uni-directional signals u n 31 and u n 32 are decoded, then the superposition of the cyclic signals (h 1 λ c 13 + h 3 λ c 32 ) mod h 3 Λ c 32 ,c and (h 2 ˜ λ c 23 + h 3 λ c 31 ) mod h 3 Λ c 31 ,c , and ﬁnally, the superposition of the bi-directional signals (h 1 λ b 13 + h 3 λ b 31 ) mod h 3 Λ b 31 ,c and (h 2 λ b 23 + h 3 λ b 32 ) mod h 3 Λ b 32 ,c , succes- sively in the given order (again using successive compute- and-forward [18]), resulting in the following rate constraints\n1 2\n1 2\nIn the downlink, the relay maps each of the decoded signals into an index which is then encoded into a Gaussian codeword as follows:\nThe relay allocates a power P u r,ij to t n ij , i.e., t n ij is i.i.d N (0, P u r,ij ). It also allocates P c r,ij to s n ij and P b r,ij to r n ij . For the power constraint to be satisﬁed, it is required that the sum of these powers fulﬁls\nThe relay then sends the superposition of all t n ij , s n ij , and r n ij , denoted x n r . The decoding process at each of the nodes U 1 , U 2 , and U 3 is described next.\n1) Decoding at U 3 : U 3 decodes the messages l u 13 , l u 23 , l c 31 , l c 32 , l b 31 , l b 32 in this order while treating the other signals as noise. The necessary rate constraints for reliable decoding are\nP u r,21 + P u r,31 ). By decoding l u 13 and l u 23 , the third user can ob- tain the uni-directional messages m u 13 and m u 23 . By decoding l c 32 , the third user can obtain the superposition (h 1 λ c 13 +h 3 λ c 32 ) mod h 3 Λ c 32 ,c . Knowing λ c 32 , U 3 can extract λ c 13 and hence obtain the desired cyclic communication message m c 13 (cf. Lemma 1). Similarly, by decoding l c 31 , l b 31 and l b 32 , the mes- sages m c 23 , m b 13 , and m b 23 can be obtained. Notice that U 3 can remove t 31 . and t 32 . before decoding. We do not remove them for the purpose of having more uniﬁed expressions for all receivers.\n2) Decoding at U 2 : Since U 3 can decode its desired messages, U 2 can also decode U 3 \u2019s desired messages, since h 2 2 ≥ h 2 3 . After decoding the messages intended to U 3 , U 2 decodes the messages l u 12 , l u 32 , l c 12 , l c 21 , and l b 21 successively in this order while treating the remaining signals as noise. The\nwhere σ 2 r2 = 1 + h 2 2 (P u r,21 + P u r,31 ). In this way, U 2 is able to obtain m u 12 , m u 32 , m c 12 , m c 13 , m b 12 and m b 32 . Notice that m c 13 is not desired by U 2 , but it can be used in combination with l c 32 (recall that this can be decoded by U 2 since it can be decoded by U 3 ) to obtain m c 32 which is a desired message.\n3) Decoding at U 1 : Finally, U 1 decodes all signals that are decodable by U 2 and U 3 , followed by l u 21 and l u 31 with the following rate constraints\nThis allows U 1 to obtain all its desired messages. Let the region achieved by this scheme, for a given power allocation satisfying the power constraints, be denoted R g (P u ij , P c ij , P b ij , P u r,ij , P c r,ij , P b r,ij ). Then we have the following inner bound.\nTheorem 1. The union over all possible power allocations satisfying the rate constraints (5)-(7), and (11) of the region R g (P u ij , P c ij , P b ij , P u r,ij , P c r,ij , P b r,ij ) is an inner bound on the capacity region C g of the GYC.\nRemark 1. Notice that a larger inner bound can be achieved if we remove t n 31 and t n 32 before decoding at U 3 , and t n 21 before decoding at U 2 . Moreover, all the nodes can use different decoding orders to enlarge the inner bound. We do not consider these possibilities in this paper due to lack of space, however, the given scheme is sufﬁcient for the main result of the paper given next.\nThe given scheme achieves, within a constant gap of 7/6 per dimension, the capacity region of the GYC. Namely, the following region is achievable.\nCorollary 1. For the given GYC, the region C \u2032 g given by R 31 + R 32 ≤ C(h 2 3 P ) − 2 R 13 + R 23 ≤ C(h 2 3 P ) − 2\nR 12 + R 13 + R 32 ≤ C(h 2 2 P + h 2 3 P ) − 3 R 13 + R 23 + R 12 ≤ C(h 2 2 P + h 2 3 P ) − 3 R 12 + R 31 + R 32 ≤ C(h 2 1 P + h 2 2 P ) − 3 R 13 + R 23 + R 21 ≤ C(h 2 1 P + h 2 3 P ) − 3\nThe region C \u2032 g is within a constant gap of an outer bound on the capacity region of the GYG (bounds given in [13]). Details are not given due to the lack of space.\nA transmission scheme is proposed for the Y-channel by using network coding ideas. The achievability scheme is based on three different strategies, a bi-directional, a cyclic, and a uni-directional strategy. While the ﬁrst and the last are used to establish the capacity of the bi-directional relay channel, the second is new. Nested-lattices have been used to establish network coding. The achievable rate region of the given scheme is given. It turns out that the given scheme achieves the capacity region within a constant gap."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"C.
