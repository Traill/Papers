For example, NSI can be used to design the transmit signals in order to align [1], [2], [3], or to neutralize [4] interference. Also, output feedback can be used in interference channels to create better alternative paths to the destinations [5], [6], and hence, increasing the capacity. However, a fundamental consideration for both NSI and output feedback is that they are subject to delay that is imposed by the feedback channels from the receivers.\nRecently, there has been a noticable growing interest in studying the effect of lack of up-to-date NSI at the transmitters in wireless networks. In particular, in [1], authors have consid- ered the MIMO broadcast channel and have shown that even completely stale network state information is still very useful and can change the scale of the capacity, measured by the degrees of freedom (DoF). The main idea behind the algorithm is that instead of predicting future network state information, we should focus on the side-information provided in the past signaling stages via the feedback links. This idea was initially proposed for packet erasure channels with ARQ feedback [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. The idea is that if the transmitter sends data to one receiver, but is informed through ACK/NACK feedback that the message is received by the unintended receiver(s), then this information can be exploited in later stages of signaling to reduce the time needed for communication.\nThe result of [1] was extended in [12] to the case of the MIMO Gaussian interference channel with delayed-NSI and output feedback. In particular, the DoF region of the MIMO IC is characterized, and it is shown that having output feedback can strictly enlarge the DoF region compared to the case where only delayed-NSI is available at the transmitters.\nIn this paper, we consider the two-user interference channel and study how delayed output feedback and delayed-NSI can\nbe utilized to manage interference between the users. Moti- vated by the early results of [9] on packet erasure channels, we focus on a basic setting with binary inputs and binary fading of the channels.\nAs a benchmark, we characterize the capacity region with full-NSI and output feedback. We show that presence of output feedback links can noticably enlarge the capacity region. However, what we are interested in is the capacity region of the two-user binary IC with delayed-NSI and output feedback.\nIn our earlier work [13] for the two-user binary fading IC with delayed-NSI, we have shown how outdated NSI can be systematically utilized in order to enhance the achievable sum- rate. In particular, we proposed a two-phase transmission strat- egy, where in the ﬁrst phase, both transmitters send uncoded bits to the receivers simultaneously. Then in the second phase, the transmitted bits in the ﬁrst phase could be categorized into different \u201cvirtual states\u201d based on the outdated NSI. The bits for which the transmission has not been completed, could be elevated into two different sub-problems: the two-source multicast, and the two-user IC with side-information. One key observation was that, for any bit that is communicated successfully in the former sub-problem, two bits are delivered at the receivers. Therefore, although the latter sub-problem has a higher sum-rate, the former sub-problem has a higher \u201ceffective\u201d sum-rate.\nIn this work, we demonstrate how delayed output feedback can be utilized to further improve the achievable rates. It is well known that transmitter cooperation can be created by the means of output feedback. We exploit this opportunity and we show that all the bits in the second phase, can now be elevated to the more efﬁcient sub-problem (the two-source multicast) which in turn results in a higher achievable sum-rate.\nWe also derive new outer-bounds on the capacity region of the two-user binary fading IC with delayed-NSI and output feedback. The key part is to focus on one transmitter and see how it can privilege one receiver to the other one given outdated NSI and maximize this privilege.\nRelated work: There has been several works in the literature to study the DoF region of Gaussian interference and X channels with delayed-NSI [3], [14], [15]. However, except for some particular examples, the achievable schemes are not optimal and there is a large gap between the achievable rates and the available converses. This is one of our motivations to consider the two-user binary fading IC with delayed-NSI and output feedback, in order to understand how interference\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we formulate our problem. In Section III, we present our main results. In Section IV, we will provide our achievability scheme. Next in Section V, we describe our outer-bounds.\nWe consider a two-user interference channel (IC) as in Figure 1(a). The channel gain from transmitter Tx i to receiver Rx j at time instant t is denoted by C ij [t], i, j ∈ {1, 2}. We assume that the channel gains are either 0 or 1, and they are distributed as i.i.d. (independent from each other and over time) Bernoulli random variables (i.e., C ij [t] d ∼ B(p)) where i, j ∈ {1, 2}, and 0 ≤ p ≤ 1. Deﬁne q = 1 − p.\nAt each time instant t, the transmit signal at transmitter Tx i is denoted by X i [t] ∈ {0, 1}, and the received signal at receiver Rx i is given by\nY i [t] = C ii [t]X i [t] ⊕ C ¯ ii [t]X ¯ i [t], i ∈ {1, 2}, \t (1) where ¯i = 3 − i, and the summation is in F 2 .\nFurthermore, the network state information (NSI) at time instant t is denoted by the quadruple\nWe use the following notations in this paper. We use capital letters to denote random variables (RVs), e.g. C ij [t] is a ran- dom variable at time instant t. We use small letters to denote a particular realization of the corresponding random variable, e.g. c ij [t] is a particular realization of random variable C ij [t]. Suppose S ⊆ Z + is of size |S| > 0 and S = {s 1 , s 2 , . . . , s |S| } where s 1 < s 2 < . . . < s |S| . Then we deﬁne\nmoreover, we set i : j equal to {i, i + 1, . . . , j} for i ≤ j and equal to ∅ otherwise. also, for simplicity of notation, we represent C 1:i by C i , i ≥ 1.\nIn this paper, we assume that receivers have full knowledge of the NSI, and we assume that at time instant t, each transmitter has the knowledge of the network state information up to time instant t (i.e., C t−1 ) and the distribution from which the future channel gains are drawn, t = 1, . . . , n, and we refer to this assumption as delayed-NSI.\nConsider the scenario in which transmitter Tx i wishes to reliably communicate message W i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 2 nR i } to receiver Rx i during n uses of the channel, i = 1, 2. We assume that there is a noiseless feedback link of unite capacity from each receiver to its corresponding transmitter and hence transmitter Tx i at time instant t has access to Y t−1 i , i = 1, 2. Moreover, we assume that the messages and the channel gains are mutually independent and the messages are chosen uniformly. For each transmitter Tx i , let message W i be encoded as X n i using an encoding function that depends on the available NSI at transmitter Tx i and Y t−1 i . Receiver Rx i is only interested in decoding W i , and it will decode the message using the decoding function W i = g i (Y n i , C n ).\nAn error occurs when W i = W i . The average probability of decoding error is given by\nand the expectation is taken with respect to the random choice of the transmitted messages W 1 and W 2 . A rate tuple (R 1 , R 2 ) is said to be achievable, if there exists encoding and decoding functions at the transmitters and the receivers respectively, such that the decoding error probabilities λ 1,n , λ 2,n go to zero as n goes to inﬁnity.\nWe study the capacity region of the two-user binary IC with delayed-NSI and output feedback in detail. We ﬁrst derive a new achievable rate region for the two-user binary IC described in Section II. Our achievability demonstrates how outdated NSI and previously received signals can be systematically exploited in order to enhance the achievable sum-rate. Presence of output feedback links provides the co- operation opportunity among the transmitters. We incorporate this opportunity in our achievability scheme and the achievable rate region would be larger than our earlier results in [13] where no output feedback link is available.\nThen, we derive new outer-bounds on the capacity region of the two-user binary IC with delayed NSI and output feedback that is strictly smaller than that of the full-NSI and output feedback. The main idea is to consider one transmitter and see how it can privilege one receiver to the other one given outdated NSI and maximize this privilege.\nAs a benchmark, we consider two extreme cases: (1) no- NSI (i.e., transmitters only know the distribution from which the channel gains are drawn, but not the actual realization of them) and no output feedback; and (2) full-NSI (i.e., the network state information C t is available at each transmitter at time instant t) and output feedback. The following lemma presents the capacity regions in these cases.\nLemma 1: The capacity region of the two-user binary IC described in Section II with no-NSI and no output feedback, C no , and with full-NSI and output feedback, C FNSI,OFB , are\nThe proof for (5) is the same as what will be presented for Lemma 2, and the proof for (6) is removed due to space limitations. The following theorem states our main results.\nTheorem 1: For the two-user binary IC described in Sec- tion II with delayed-NSI at the transmitters and output feed- back, the capacity region C DNSI,OFB satisﬁes\n  \n \n2R i + R ¯ i ≤ 2 1 − q 2 + p 2 q (1−q 2 ) , i = 1, 2. (10)\nFigures 1(b), (c), and (d) depict our results for p = 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75. Figure 1(c) summerizes our results in [13] as well.\nRemark 1: As it can be seen in Figure 1, the capacity region with delayed-NSI and output feedback is strictly smaller than the case of full-NSI and output feedback. Hence, the delay in learning the NSI results in a capacity region loss.\nIn this section, we present the transmission strategy for the binary IC with delayed-NSI and output feedback. For R delayed,FB as described in (8) the corner points are\nwhere α is given in (9). The ﬁrst two corner points are achievable with no-NSI. We describe a transmission strategy that achieves arbitrary close to the latter corner point. Thus, with time sharing, we get the desired result. We will use the following result in our transmission strategy.\nConsider a network with two transmitters and two receivers where each transmitter Tx i wishes to communicate an inde- pendent message W i to both receivers, i = 1, 2. The channel gain model is the same as described in Section II. We refer to this network as the two-source multicast networ.\nLemma 2: For the two-source multicast network as de- scribed above, we have\nThe capacity region of the two-source multicast network is equal to the capacity region of the multiple access chan- nel (MAC) formed by the two transmitters and one of the receivers. Hence, deriving the converse is straightforward and omitted. Here, we brieﬂy describe the achievability scheme. In [16], it has been shown that for a point-to-point erasure channel with capacity C, using random block coding of length n, a rate R is achievable where C − 3δ < R ≤ C − 2δ, and the decoding error probability is less than or equal to 2 for ﬁxed , δ > 0.\nIn our problem, each channel behaves as an erasure channel with capacity p. We can model the channel from transmitter Tx 2 to receiver Rx 1 as an erasure channel with erasure probability equal to pq (C 11 [t] = 1 or C 21 [t] = 0 is considered as erasure). Therefore, we know that a rate arbitrary close pq is achievable. Receiver Rx 1 decodes W 2 and removes X n 2 from its received signal. Now the channel from Tx 1 to Rx 1 becomes an erausre channel with erasure probability p. Therefore, we have a sum-rate arbitrary close to p + pq = 1 − q 2 .\nWe now formally describe the achievability strategy for the corner point in (11). We consider 3 distinct states of a bit at transmitter Tx i : (1) Q i→i denotes the initial state of the bits; (2) Q i→{1,2} denotes the bits that are of interest of both receivers; and (3) Q i→F denotes the successfully transmitted bits that do not fall in Q i→{1,2} , i = 1, 2.\nDeﬁne m = nR 1 = nR 2 , and let W 1 = a 1 , . . . , a m , and W 2 = b 1 , . . . , b m , where a i \u2019s and b i \u2019s are picked uni- formly and independently from {0, 1}, i = 1, . . . , m.\nPhase 1 (raw bit transmission): At the beginning of the communication block, we assume that the bits at transmitter Tx i are in state Q i→i . At each time instant, transmitter Tx i sends a bit from Q i→i . Then, based on the channel gain real- izations, a total of 16 possible conﬁgurations may occur at any time instant, see Table I. In cases 5, 6, 13, 16 (9, 10, 14, 16), no change happens in the status of a transmitted bit from transmitter Tx 2 (Tx 1 ) and therefore, such bit remains in state Q 2→2 (Q 1→1 ). In cases 4, 9, 10 (4, 5, 6), the transmitted bit from transmitter Tx 2 (Tx 1 ) is communicated successfully and joins Q 2→F (Q 1→F ). The description for other cases is\nprovided below. Transmitters keep sending bits from the initial states until they become empty (if one of the initial states becomes empty ﬁrst, the corresponding transmitter will simply remain silent until the end of phase 1).\n\u2022 Case 1: Each receiver gets a linear combination of the transmitted bits, see Table I. Now, if either of such bits is provided to both receivers, then they can decode both bits.\n\u2022 Cases 2 and 3: Consider the transmitted bits in cases 2 and 3 as in Figure 2. We can combine the two states and solve them simultaneously by providing a i ⊕ b j to both receivers. The combination of two bits can be created by either one of the transmitters. Note that using output feedback links, Tx 1 (Tx 2 ) has access to bit b j (a i ).\n\u2022 Case 7: Receiver Rx 1 gets a linear combination of the transmitted bits. Now, if the bit of transmitter Tx 2 is provided to both receivers, then each receivers can decode its bit. Cases 8,11, and 12 are similar.\n\u2022 Case 15: In this case, receiver Rx i has received the transmit- ted bit of transmitter Tx ¯ i , i = 1, 2. Using feedback links, each transmitter will have access to the other transmitter\u2019s bit as well. Now if the combination of the two bits is provided to the receivers, they can decode the intended bits. This combination can be provided by either of the two transmitters. Cases 13 and 14 can be treated together as case 15.\nIn the aforementioned cases, providing a bit (which can be a combination of two bits) to both receivers is sufﬁcient. Although in some cases, both transmitters have the possibility to send this bit, just one of them needs to do so. We would like to have almost equal number of bits in Q 1→{1,2} and Q 2→{1,2} (the reason will be clear in Phase 2). To do so, if a pairing opportunity is available at time t where t is odd (even), then the required combination of bits joins Q 1→{1,2} (Q 2→{1,2} ). After the initial states become empty, the transmission of the bits in Q i→{1,2} , i = 1, 2, continue in phase 2.\nPhase 2 (multicast transmission): Note that the bits in Q i→{1,2} are of interest of both receivers. In this phase, the bits in Q i→{1,2} are considered as the message of transmitter Tx i in the problem of two-source multicast, and they will be encoded as in the achievability scheme of Lemma 2.\nIn the remaining of this section, we provide the analysis of the achievable sum-rate using our two-phase transmission strategy and its decoding error probability. In particular, we show that with probability approching 1 as m → ∞, the required time to transmit all 2m initial bits is at most\nRequired time to ﬁnish phase 1: The number of remaining bits in Q i→i during phase 1 is a Markov chain that at each time instant, the value will either decrease by 1 or remain unchanged, i = 1, 2. The total initial number of bits is equal to 2m. Let random variable T 1 denote the number of time instants in which phase 1 will be over (when both initial queues become empty). Using union bound and Chernoff bound, we can show that\nWe consider the event E = T 1 ≥ 1 − q 2 −1 m + m 2 3 as error, and we halt the transmission strategy if E occurs.\nRequired time to ﬁnish phase 2: Let random variable N i→{1,2} denote the number of bits in Q i→{1,2} . Upon com- pletion of phase 1, we have\nfor i = 1, 2. If event N i→{1,2} ≥ E[N i→{1,2} ] + m 2 3 occurs, we consider it as error and we halt the transmission strategy.\nAt the end of phase 1, we add 0\u2019s (if necessary) in order to make all states of size equal to the corresponding expected value plus m 2 3 . Therefore, as m → ∞, the number of bits in each state goes to inﬁnity. We are now ready to caluculate the required time to transmit the remaining bits in phase 2.\nWe use the achievability scheme of the two-source multicast problem for the bits in states Q 1→{1,2} and Q 2→{1,2} . In other\nwords, for ﬁxed , δ ∈ R + and for sufﬁciently large m, a sum- rate of 1 − q 2 − δ is achievable with decoding error probability less than or equal to using random block coding. Therefore for sufﬁciently large m, the required time to transmit the bits in states Q i→{1,2} , i = 1, 2, is t 2 = E[N 1→{1,2} ]+m\nwith decoding error probability less than or equal .\nHence, as m → ∞ and , δ → 0, the total trans- mission time is less than or equal to the value given in (13). Therefore, we achieve a (symmetric) sum-rate of 2 1 − q 2 −1 + p 1 − q 2 −2\n, with probability approach- ing 1 and decoding error probability less than or euqal to\nSuppose there exist encoders and decoders as described in Section II such that rate tuple (R 1 , R 2 ) is achievable with arbitrary small decoding error probability as n → ∞. The outer-bound on R i is essentially the capacity result for an erasure channel with success probability p, and the one on R 1 + R 2 follows from the full-NSI case. The outer-bound on 2R 1 + R 2 can be obtained as follows.\n≤ 2I(W 1 ; Y n 1 |C n ) + I(W 2 ; Y n 1 |W 1 , C n ) + I(W 2 ; Y n 2 |W 1 , Y n 1 , C n ) + 3 n\n+ H(Y n 2 |W 1 , Y n 1 , C n ) − H(Y n 2 |W 1 , W 2 , Y n 1 , C n ) + 3 n = 2H(Y n 1 |C n ) − H(Y n 1 |W 1 , C n ) + H(Y n 2 |W 1 , Y n 1 , C n ) + 3 n\n≤ 2H(Y n 1 |C n ) + H(C n 22 X n 2 |W 1 , X n 1 , C n ) − H(C n 21 X n 2 |W 1 , X n 1 , C n ) + 3 n\nwhere (a) holds due to Fano\u2019s inequality and the fact that messages and C n are mutually independent; and (b) can be derived by simple calculations.\nClaim 1: For the two-user IC as deﬁned in Section II with delayed-NSI and output feedback, we have\ndividing both sides by n and let n → ∞, we get the desired outer-bound.\nWe studied the capacity region of the two-user binary fading interference channel with delayed network state information and output feedback. We provided new techniques for both achievability and converse. However, the inner-bounds and the outer-bounds do not match. Hence, an important direction is to completely charaterize the capacity region for this problem.\nThe research of A. S. Avestimehr and A.
