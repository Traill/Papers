We provide a new inner bound (achievable rate region) to the capac- ity region for this channel. This inner bound is based on a new class of code ensembles based on asymptoti- cally good nested linear codes. This achievable region is strictly superior to the straightforward extension of Han-Kobayashi rate region from the case of two- users to three-users. This rate region is characterized using single-letter information quantities. We consider examples to illustrate the rate region."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"A. B.
