In this paper, it is investigated that the trade-off between the rate of the random number to realize the stochastic encoding and the rates of the common, private, and conﬁdential messages. For the direct theorem, the superposition coding scheme for the wire-tap channel recently proposed by Chia and El Gamal is employed, and its strong security is proved. The matching converse theorem is also established. Our result clariﬁes that a combination of the ordinary stochastic encoding and the channel preﬁxing by the channel simulation is suboptimal.\n( K n , ^ ^"},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"A. D.
