Both classical correlations and quantum correlations (en- tanglement) are considered. The amount of heat converted into work is proportional to the entropy defect of the initial state of the system. The equivalence relation between information and work is explicitly demonstrated for the case of two-particle correlations.

Using the setup of a \u201cthought experiment\u201d related to Gibbs\u2019s paradox, it was shown[4], [5], [6] that using a system of two gases of N molecules each, with the molecules being in different (in general, nonorthogonal) quantum states ρ (1) and ρ (2) , it is possible to convert completely into mechanical work an amount of heat, taken from a thermostat, which is proportional to the entropy defect[7] of the system\nwhere W is work, T the temperature of the thermostat, and I 0 the entropy defect (also called \u201cquantum information\u201d or \u201cLevitin\u2013Holevo bound\u201d[8], [9]) of the system per molecule, which, in this particular case, is\nEntropy defect has the meaning of information (about the microstate of the system) associated with the selection of a subensemble (in this example, ρ (1) or ρ (2) ) from the total ensemble ρ.\nIt was conjectured[4], [5], [6] that there exists a general equivalence relation between information and work; namely, that by having any information J about the state of a physical system, it is possible, by allowing the system to relax to its maximum-entropy state, to convert into mechanical work an amount of heat W = kT J without any entropy increase in the environment. (Of course, all information J is lost in the process, since the system reaches the thermal equilibrium state that has the same energy and volume as the initial state.)\nSince then, a number of papers (in particular, [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]) has been devoted to various aspects of the connection between information and work. However, the general equivalence relation remains up to now unproven. (Part of the problem, in our opinion, is the still existing fuzziness of distinction between \u201cmechanical work\u201d and \u201cheat.\u201d) Moreover, all real-life examples of getting work from a non-equilibrium system (e.g., chemical reactions, sep- arated electrical charges, compressed gas) by allowing it to relax to equilibrium are based on the information contained in one-particle distributions\u2014as if all the particles comprising the system were independent. To the best of our knowledge, information stored in multi-particle distributions has never been used to extract mechanical work.\nHere we address the problem of using information contained in two-particle correlations for converting heat into work. Our analysis is based on two important assumptions:\n1) Since a unitary transformation of the system\u2019s state does not change its entropy, it can be performed without any energy dissipation; and\n2) Since orthogonal quantum states are perfectly distin- guishable, there exist partitions which are permeable for one of such states but not for the other (a well-known example of such \u201cpartitions\u201d is a light polarizer).\nIn order to avoid getting involved in deﬁnitional arguments\u2014such as appear sometimes in the physics literature\u2014concerning the distinction between work and heat, we shall consider an isothermal quasistatic process in which heat is taken from a thermostat and eventually transferred to another system in a form that is inequivocally mechanical work\u2014namely, the lifting of a weight.\nWe shall treat in separate sections the case when the two particles are classically correlated and that dealing with quantum correlations, and conclude with a discussion of the overall results.\nConsider a gas of molecules that consist of two different atoms, A and B. To each atom is associated a 2-dimensional Hilbert space of states with basis vectors |0 and |1 (a qubit [18]). The thermal equilibrium (maximum-entropy) state\nStates ρ 1 and ρ 2 are orthogonal, and correspond to (classi- cally) fully correlated atoms A and B. Each of these states has an entropy defect (in nats) I c = ln 2 per pair, or J c = N ln 2 for a gas of N molecules. Note that the one-particle proba- bilities of states |0 and |1 of both atoms are the same in states ρ 1 and ρ 2 as at equilibrium. Therefore, it is impossible to distinguish between this state and the equilibrium state on the basis of one-particle measurements.\nWithout loss of generality, assume we know that the gas is in state ρ 1 (let us call it gas 1). Let the gas occupy a vessel of volume 2V divided by a partition into two equal parts of volume V , each occupied by N 2 molecules, and being in thermal contact with a thermostat at temperature T . To the gas on the right side of the partition apply a unitary transformation U 1 = I A ⊗U B , where I A is the identity operator in the Hilbert space of A and U B the operator that interchanges states |0\nand |1 of B\u2014that is, the Pauli matrix σ x . Transformation U 1 converts gas 1 into a gas with density matrix ρ 2 (gas 2).\nNow, replace the partition by two movable semipermeable partitions such that the partition that faces gas 1 is permeable to gas 1 but not to gas 2, and vice versa for the other partition. Since the total pressure of the mixed gases is larger than the pressure of one of the gases, the two partitions will be pushed apart\u2014and we can use the setup shown in Fig. 1 to lift weights m 1 and m 2 .\nConsider the moment when the right partition has advanced to the right by a volume V 1 and the left partition to the left by a volume V 2 . Gas 1 will then ﬁll the volume V + V 1 and gas 2 the volume V + V 2 . Let us assume that the gases are ideal and rareﬁed. Then the pressures of the gases to the left, to the right, and in between the partitions are, respectively,\nThe work produced by the gas by lifting masses of appropriate weights in this quasistatic isothermal process is\nNote that the total energy of the system has not changed in the process. Thus, the amount of heat converted into mechanical work is proportional to the entropy defect of the system,\nBy the end of the process the entire vessel is occupied by a mixture of gas 1 and gas 2 with density matrix ρ. The initial information about the location of each pair of atoms, contained in the correlation of states of the two atoms in a molecule, is now erased, and this increase in entropy exactly compensates for the decrease of entropy of the thermostat.\nConsider now the case where atoms forming a molecule are in a fully entangled state. There are four such states of two qubits, namely, the Bell states[8] Φ + , Φ − , Ψ + , and Ψ − , deﬁned as follows\nThese four states are orthogonal and form a basis in the 4- dimensional tensor-product Hilbert space of those two atoms. The entropy defect of the system in one of those states is I e = 2 ln 2 per pair, or J e = 2N ln 2 for the whole gas (as before, we assume the gas to be ideal and the states of the molecules, independent).\nSuppose that the gas is initially in state Φ + . Then, by use of the same transformation U 1 as in the previous section, we can convert half of the gas molecules into state Ψ + . Using the same setup as in Fig. 1, we obtain work W 1 = N kT ln 2; the ﬁnal state of the gas will be a mixture\nNow we can use a unitary transformation U 2 = U Φ ⊗ U Ψ , where U Φ is the unitary transformation that permutes Φ + and Φ − in the subspace spanned by these ortogonal states, and U Ψ analogously permutes Ψ + and Ψ − . Transformation U 2 converts ρ (1) into a mixed state\nNote that states ρ (1) and ρ (2) are orthogonal, and thus per- fectly distinguishable.\nEmploying transformation U 2 and using the same setup as before, we can now repeat the mixing procedure. This will yield additional work W 2 = N k ln 2, bringing the system to the equilibrium state ρ = 1 2 (ρ (1) + ρ (2) ). Hence, the total amount of heat converted into work is\nSince the entropy defect of the entangled states is two times as large as that of classically correlated states, the amount of work W e is also larger than R c by a factor of 2.\nThe above results demonstrate the equivalence relation be- tween information and work for the case when the information is contained only in two-particle probability distributions, and cannot be extracted from a mere one-particle distribution.\nThe situation with the equivalence between information and work in general remains unclear and, in a way, paradoxical. On one hand, many researchers are strongly convinced of it and express it in a very ﬁrm way, e.g.,\u201cInformation has an energetic value: It can be converted into work\u201d (Zureck[19]; but cf. [17]). (In fact, it is not information that can be converted into work, but heat that can be converted into work by use of information.) On the other hand, in our opinion, one still lacks a convincing general proof that any kind of information can be equally successfully used to convert heat into any kind of work, so that the general statement remains a sort of \u201cfolk theorem.\u201d We believe that the root of this problem is the fact that, in spite of many unquestionable examples of \u201cwork\u201d known to physicists, there is no general rigorous deﬁnition that would distinguish between these two forms of energy transfer\u2014heat and work.\nInformally speaking, work is an \u201cinformed\u201d transfer of energy, i.e., a transfer such that we know exactly the change of the state of each degree of freedom, resulting from this transfer; while heat is energy transfered in such a way that we have no such knowledge. From that viewpoint, the equivalence between information and work becomes indeed a tautology. However, a rigorous formalization of these ideas has not yet been presented.\nWe wish to thank Charles Bennett for bringing to our attention a number of related papers, and to Oscar Dahlsten and Michal Horodecki for updated references."},"refs":[{"authors":[],"title":{"text":" ¨ Uber die entropieverminderung in einem thermody- namischen system bei eingriffen intelligenter wesen\u201d (\u201cOn the decrease of entropy in a thermodynamic system by the intervention of intelligent beings"}},{"authors":[],"title":{"text":"The thermodynamics of computation\u2014a review"}},{"authors":[],"title":{"text":"Information theory for quantum systems"}},{"authors":[],"title":{"text":"Gibbs\u2019 paradox and equivalence relation between quantum information and work"}},{"authors":[],"title":{"text":"Quantum information theory"}},{"authors":[],"title":{"text":"P ERES , Asher, Quantum Theory, Concepts and Methods , Kluwer 1993"}},{"authors":[],"title":{"text":"The work value of information"}},{"authors":[],"title":{"text":"Quantum foru-stroke engine: Thermodynamic observables in a model with intrinsic friction"}},{"authors":[],"title":{"text":"Quantum- mechanical Maxwell\u2019s demon"}},{"authors":[],"title":{"text":"Extracting work from a single thermal bath via quantum negentropy"}},{"authors":[],"title":{"text":"Quantum discord and Maxwell\u2019s demons"}},{"authors":[],"title":{"text":"Quantum coding"}},{"authors":[],"title":{"text":"Quantum discord and Maxwell\u2019s demons"}}]},"file":{"jsonClass":"File","file":"/home/arnfred/Code/trailhead/resources/isit2012/1569553591.pdf"},"links":[],"meta":{"jsonClass":"HashMap$HashTrieMap","sessionid":"S6.T9.1","endtime":"11:50","authors":"Lev B Levitin, Tommaso Toffoli","date":"1341315000000","papertitle":"Work recoverable from two-particle information","starttime":"11:30","session":"S6.T9: Tools for Quantum Information Theory","room":"Stratton West Lounge (201)","paperid":"1569553591"},"cluster":{"jsonClass":"Map$EmptyMap$"}}
