In such protocols, two legitimate users (Alice and Bob) and an eavesdropper (Eve) observe the real- izations of correlated random variables (RV\u2019s). The legitimate users, who can exchange messages over a public channel, aim at extracting a common secret key from their observations. The rules by which the legitimate users compute the messages they exchange over the public channel and agree on a key deﬁne a key-distillation strategy. The maximum number of secret-key bits per observed realization of the RV\u2019s is called the secret- key capacity [1].\nClosed-form expressions of the secret-key capacity have been established for a large variety of models [1][3]. In general, however, they do not provide direct insight into the design of practical key-distillation strategies achieving the secret-key capacity since the proofs handle reliability (the legitimate users must share the same key) and secrecy (the key must be unknown to the eavesdropper) concurrently.\nFor practical key-distillation, as in quantum key distribu- tion [4] or wireless secure communication [5], a sequential key-distillation strategy is often used. Such a strategy consists of two phases that handle reliability and secrecy successively, instead of simultaneously. A reconciliation phase [6] is ﬁrst performed, during which Alice and Bob communicate over the public channel to agree on a common bit sequence, that might not be totally hidden from Eve. Then, a privacy am- pliﬁcation phase [7][8] is performed, during which Alice and Bob apply a deterministic function to their shared sequence to generate their common secret key, this time completely unknown from Eve. The main advantage of sequential key- distillation strategies is to provide a practical key-distillation\ndesign; indeed, reconciliation can be efﬁciently implemented with LDPC codes [9][10] and privacy ampliﬁcation can be performed with hash functions or with extractors [7][8]. More- over, for a source model [2][11] with a public channel of inﬁnite capacity, such a strategy is optimal and both phases can be optimized and designed independently, thus allowing a reconciliation design totally independent of the eavesdropper\u2019s observation statistics [11] \u2013 this contrasts with a joint design of reconciliation and privacy ampliﬁcation [3].\nIn this paper, we study sequential-key distillation with rate-limited public communication to account for realistic constraints (real equipment may have limited bandwidth re- sources, such as in a wireless sensors network). Although, the secret-key capacity is already known, we provide an achiev- ability scheme that, unlike the one in [3], easily translates into practical codes. The main contributions are\n\u2022 the characterization of the one-way rate-limited reconcil- iation capacity;\n\u2022 the proof that, for a degraded source, the sequential application of reconciliation and privacy ampliﬁcation with extractors, is an optimal key-distillation strategy for a one-way rate-limited public channel;\n\u2022 the illustration of our results in the binary case, for which reconciliation and privacy ampliﬁcation can be designed and optimized independently.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we formally introduce the problem studied in the paper. In Section III, we characterize the one-way rate-limited reconciliation capacity, and we prove that the sequential application of reconciliation and privacy ampliﬁcation with extractors is an optimal key-distillation strategy. In Section IV, we illustrate our results in the binary case.\nAs illustrated in Figure 1, a source model for secret- key agreement represents a situation in which two legitimate\nusers, Alice and Bob, and one eavesdropper, Eve, observe the components, X, Y , and Z, of a discrete memoryless source (DMS) (X YZ, p XY Z ) , respectively. The DMS is assumed to be outside the control of all parties, but its statistics are known.\nWe assume a one-way communication over an authenticated noiseless public channel with limited rate R p . We suppose that Alice is the one who sends messages, 1 and that she is allowed to randomize her messages, i.e. she has access to a source of local randomness. In addition, we suppose that X , Y , and Z form a Markov chain \u2013 common examples for which this hypothesis is valid, are sources generated over the degraded broadcast channel, or over channels such that p XZ |Y = p X |Y p Z |Y , as in a wireless context for instance.\nAssuming a key alphabet K of size 2 nR , the protocol deﬁned by the three following steps is called a (2 nR , n, R p ) key- distillation strategy [1], and it will be denoted by S n .\n1) Alice observes n realizations of the source X n while Bob observes Y n ;\n2) Alice generates a realization R X of her source of local randomness and transmits A(X n , R X ) , under the restric- tion H(A) nR p ;\n3) Alice computes K(X n , R X ) ∈ K while Bob computes ˆ K(Y n , A) ∈ K.\nThe performance of a key-distillation strategy S n is measured in terms of the average probability of error between the key K generated by Alice and the key ˆ K generated by Bob P e ( S n )\nP[K = ˆ K |S n ], in terms of the information leakage to the eavesdropper L(S n ) I(K; Z n A |S n ), and in terms of the uniformity of the keys U(S n ) log 2 nR − H(K|S n ).\nDeﬁnition 1. A secret-key rate R is achievable for a source model if there exists a sequence of (2 nR , n, R p ) key-distillation strategies {S n } n 1 such that\nMoreover, the supremum of such a rate R is called the secret- key capacity.\nTheorem 1 ([3],[12]). Let (X YZ, p XY Z ) be a DMS. Let R p be the rate of the public channel. If X → Y → Z forms a Markov chain, then the secret-key capacity C s (R p ) is\nTheorem 2 ([11]). Let (X YZ, p XY Z ) be a DMS. Suppose R p = + ∞. Then all secret-key rates R s that satisfy\nare achievable with sequential secret-key distillation strategies that consist of a reconciliation protocol and privacy ampliﬁ- cation with extractors (or hash functions).\nTheorem 2 means that we can handle reliability and secrecy successively; reconciliation deals with reliability, whereas pri- vacy ampliﬁcation deals with secrecy.\nOur main result, presented in Section III-C, is similar to Theorem 2 for ﬁnite R p , i.e any secret-key rate below C s (R p ) (Theorem 1) is achievable by a sequential key-distillation strategy consisting of one-way rate-limited reconciliation and privacy ampliﬁcation with extractors.\nBefore we show the main result in Section III-C, we determine the reconciliation capacity in Section III-A and we review privacy ampliﬁcation with extractors in Section III-B.\nDeﬁnition 2. Let R p ∈ R + . A one-way rate-limited recon- ciliation protocol R n (R p ), noted R n for convenience, for a source model with DMS ( X Y, p XY ) consists of\n\u2022 a source of local randomness ( R, p R ) for Alice; \u2022 an encoding function f : X n × R → A;\n\u2022 two functions η a : X n × R → S and η b : Y n × A → S; and operates as follows\n\u2022 Alice observes n realizations of the source X n while Bob observes Y n ;\n\u2022 Alice generates a realization R X of her source of local randomness and transmits A = f (X n , R X ), under the restriction H(A) nR p ;\n\u2022 Alice computes S = η a (X n , R X ) while Bob computes ˆ S = η b (Y n , A).\nThe reliability performance of a reconciliation protocol is measured in terms of the average probability of error P e ( R n ) \t P[S = ˆ S |R n ]. In addition, since the common sequence S generated by a reconciliation protocol is followed by a privacy ampliﬁcation step, the protocol should leak as little information as possible over the public channel. As in [11] we deﬁne the reconciliation rate of a reconciliation protocol as\nDeﬁnition 3. For a given R p , a reconciliation rate R is achievable, if there exists a sequence of one-way rate-limited reconciliation protocols {R n } n 1 such that\nMoreover, the supremum of such a rate R is called the reconciliation capacity.\nProposition 1. The reconciliation capacity C rec (R p ) is C rec (R p ) = max\nProof: In the following, we only prove the converse part. The achievability is based on Wyner-Ziv coding and is similar to the proof in [13]; the determination of the cardinality constraint uses standard techniques.\nI(S; A |Y n R X ) + H(S |AY n R X ) = H(S |R X ) − I(S; Y n |R X )\nX ) (d) = n[I(S; X\nJ | ˜ U ) − I(S; Y J | ˜ U )] (e) = n [I(U; X\nwhere (a) holds by the rate condition H(A) R p and by Fano\u2019s inequality, since for any > 0, there exists a reconcil- iation protocol such that P(S = ˆ S) δ( ) , 2 (b) holds since ˆ\nS = η b (Y n , A) and conditioning reduces entropy, (c) holds because H(S|X n R X ) = 0 , since S = η a (X n , R X ) , (d) is from Lemma 4.1 in [2] if we set ˜\nJ a RV uniformly distributed on 1, n , independent from all previous RV\u2019s, and (e) holds if we set U = S ˜ U , since X J and ˜ U are independent.\nH(S) − I(S; A|Y n ) − H(S|Y n A) = I(S; Y n )\nP(J = i)I(SY n J+1 X J −1 R X ; Y J |J = i) = nI(U; Y J ),\nwhere (f) holds by Fano\u2019s inequality, and (g) holds since the Y i \u2019s are i.i.d.\nIt is reassuring to note that C rec (R p ) I(X; Y ) by the data processing inequality. Note that randomization of Alice\u2019s mes- sages is unnecessary to achieve the reconciliation capacity. Ob- serve also that, if R p = + ∞ and U = X in Proposition 1, we re-obtain the result in [11], i.e. C rec (R p = + ∞) = I(X; Y ). Moreover, C rec (R p ) = I(X; Y ) for any R p > H(X |Y ), meaning that all results in [11] for the case R p = + ∞, are in fact still valid if R p > H(X |Y ).\nRemark Reconciliation is closely related to common random- ness [2]. Although achievability proofs are similar, converse parts differ because the metrics optimized are different.\nDuring the privacy ampliﬁcation phase, Alice and Bob generate their secret key by applying a deterministic function, on which they publicly agreed ahead of time, to their common sequence obtained after reconciliation. This phase will be performed with extractors [14], which are functions that take as input a sequence of n arbitrarily distributed bits and output a sequence of k nearly uniformly distributed bits, using another input of d truly uniformly distributed bits. The following theorem provides a lower bound on the size of the key, on which the legitimate users agree.\nTheorem 3 ([8] [11]). Let S ∈ {0, 1} n be the RV that represents the common sequence shared by Alice and Bob, and let E be the RV that represents the total knowledge about S available to Eve. Let e be a particular realization of E. If Alice and Bob know the conditional min-entropy H ∞ (S |E = e) to be at least γn, for some γ ∈ (0, 1), then there exists an extractor g : {0, 1} n × {0, 1} d → {0, 1} k with\nand if U d is a RV with uniform distribution on {0, 1} d and Alice and Bob choose K = g(S, U d ) as their secret key, then\nNote that, the size d of the uniformly distributed input sequence is negligible, compared to the size n of the input sequence S, so that the effect on the rate of public communica- tion is negligible. Moreover, extractors that extract almost the entire min-entropy of the input S and require comparatively negligible amount of uniform randomness can be efﬁciently constructed [14].\nRemark Privacy ampliﬁcation can be performed with hash functions, but their use requires more random bits than extrac- tors; indeed, a hash function needs to be chosen at random in universal families, which requires in the order of n random bits (see [7][11] for further details).\nIn this section, we prove that the combination of reconcil- iation and privacy ampliﬁcation is an optimal one-way rate- limited secret-key distillation strategy.\nTheorem 4. All secret-key rates R s that satisfy R s < C s (R p )\nare achievable with sequential secret key distillation strategies that consist of a rate-limited reconciliation protocol and privacy ampliﬁcation with extractors.\nProof: Let 1 > > 0 . Let R p ∈ R + . Let m, n ∈ N, and deﬁne N = nm. Let k ∈ N to be determined later. Consider a sequential key-distillation strategy S N that consists of\n\u2022 m repetitions of a reconciliation protocol R n based on Wyner-Ziv coding parametrized by a pdf p XY p X |U (see achievability proof of Proposition 1). We have S = U n and Bob\u2019s estimate ˆ U n of U n satisﬁes P[ ˆ U n = U n |R n ] \t δ 1 (n) . 3 Note that by Wyner-Ziv coding, we have U n typical and (U n , X n ) jointly typical with probability approaching one for n large;\n\u2022 privacy ampliﬁcation based on extractors, with output size k , at the end of which Alice computes her key K = g(U N , U d ) , while Bob computes ˆ K = g( ˆ U N , U d ) , where U d is a sequence of d uniformly distributed random bits.\nThe total information available to Eve after reconciliation consists of her observation Z N , the public messages A, sent by Alice, and U d . The strategy S N is also known to Eve, but we omit the conditioning on S N for convenience.\nBy means of Theorem 3, Lemma 1, and Lemma 2, we will ﬁrst show that, for a suitable choice of the output size k, we have k H(K |U d Z N A) k − δ(N). 4 Then, we will show that the corresponding secret-key rate achieves the secret-key capacity of Theorem 1. We ﬁrst recall some useful lemmas.\nLemma 1 ([8][11]). Consider a DMS (X Z, p XZ ) and deﬁne the RV Θ as\n(XZ) and Z n ∈ T n (Z), 0 otherwise.\n. Moreover, if z n ∈ T n (Z),\nLemma 2 ([8][11]). Let S ∈ S and U ∈ U be two discrete RV\u2019s with joint distribution p SU . For any r > 0, deﬁne the function Υ : U → {0, 1} as\nif H ∞ (U N |z N , a, Θ = 1) log |A|+ √ N , 0 otherwise.\nBy Lemma 1 applied to the DMS (U n Z n , p U n Z n ) , P(Θ = 1) 1 − 2 − √ m , and by Lemma 2, P(Υ = 1) 1 − 2 − √ N . Hence, P(Υ = 1, Θ = 1) 1 − 2 − √ m − 2 − √ N , and\nTo lower bound H(K|U d Z N A, Υ = 1, Θ = 1) , we will lower bound H ∞ (U N |Z N = z N , A = a, Θ = 1, Υ = 1) and use Theorem 3. By deﬁnition of Υ,\nI(U ; Y )), i.e the number of bits required to describe the messages exchanged during the reconciliation phase. We now lower bound H(U n |Z n ) . We ﬁrst remark that\nwhere (b) holds since U n → X n → Z n , (c) holds because U n is a function of X n (U n is a quantized version of X n ), and (d) is true since the X i \u2019s and Z i \u2019s are i.i.d.. Then, deﬁne\nif (X n , U n ) ∈ T n (XU ), 0 otherwise.\n2 + H(X n |Z n U n , Γ = 1, ∆ = 1) + 3nδ(n) log |X |, (4) where (e) holds since P(∆ = 0) = δ(n) (by Wyner- Ziv coding) and P(Γ = 0|∆ = 1) = δ(n) (by Markov Lemma [15]). Then,\n− 2m − Nδ(n) − mδ( ) − δ (m) − √ N . (7) Set k to be less than the lower bound in (7) by √ N :\nthus, back to (1), by Theorem 3, H(K|U d Z N A) k − δ(N). Moreover, the leakage is such that\nNote that, if we take U = X and R p = + ∞ in Theorem 4, we re-obtain the secret-key capacity C s (+ ∞) = I(X; Y ) −\nI(X; Z) seen in Theorem 2. More precisely, we obtain a result similar to the one in Section III-A for reconciliation, that is, if R p is at least H(X|Y ), then C s (R p ) = C s (+ ∞).\nTheorem 4 states that the sequential application of one-way rate-limited reconciliation and privacy ampliﬁcation with ex- tractors, leads to an optimal key-distillation strategy. However, an optimal reconciliation in the sense of Proposition 1, may not lead to an optimal sequential distillation, since the RV U that achieves C rec (R p ) in Proposition 1 might actually not achieve C s (R p ) in Theorem 1. In the next section, we study the binary case, for which optimal reconciliation leads to optimal sequential key distillation.\nAs depicted in Figure 2, assume that X has a Bernoulli distribution with parameter 1 2 , and that X and Y (respectively Y and Z) are connected by a binary symmetric channel (BSC) with crossover probability p (respectively q).\nProposition 2. The reconciliation capacity and the secret-key capacity are\nC s (R p ) = H b (p β 0 q) − H b (p β 0 ), if R p H(X |Y ), H b (p q) − H b (p), \t if R p H(X |Y ),\nwith H b ( ·) the binary entropy, and β 0 , any of the two symmetric solutions of the equation H b (p β 0 ) −H b (β 0 ) = R p , where p β 0 = (1 − β 0 )p + β 0 (1 − p).\nProof: C rec is obtained with Mrs Gerber\u2019s Lemma [16]. The converse for C s is more involved, it relies on the maximum principle and the notion of supporting hyperplane [17], the proof is not detailed because of space constraint.\nProposition 2 means that if we choose U binary and connected by a BSC to X, then we achieve C rec (R p ) , as well as C s (R p ) , so that by Proposition 1 and Theorem 4, optimal reconciliation leads to optimal sequential key distillation, i.e. reconciliation and privacy ampliﬁcation are independent."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"U.
