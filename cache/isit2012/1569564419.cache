While complete characterizations are not available, there have been signiﬁcant advances on these topics in the information theory literature. Notably the best general achievable schemes for the two channels are respectively given by Marton [1] and Han- Kobayashi [2], which are capacity achieving for some subclass channels or under various conditions, such as the ones in [3]- [6].\nMotivated by a recent interest in a heterogeneous cellular network design paradigm [7], we explore a multi-user channel that combines the broadcasting and interference features, i.e. broadcast interference channel (BIC). Speciﬁcally we envision a communication scenario where a macro base station (BS) broadcasts to two macro users, one of which is interfered by a point-to-point transmission from a femto BS to a femto user. While the BIC studied presents a simpliﬁed version of what might happen in practice, we believe that a fundamental under- standing of this simpler channel is crucial for characterizing the trade-offs in heterogeneous networks.\nVariations of BIC have been previously studied by Shang and Poor in [8], for a different interference proﬁle where interference is from the broadcast transmitter to the point-to- point receiver, and in [9], for the Gaussian BIC where both of the broadcast receivers are subject to interference. Even\nthough the channel studied in this paper has a more restrictive interference proﬁle than that in [9], we address the more general discrete memoryless channel and provide more general classes of common strategies as well as capacity regions under some conditions. Speciﬁcally, we derive an achievable rate region R based on rate splitting, superposition coding and binning at the broadcast transmitter and rate splitting at the in- terfering transmitter. This region is a natural generalization of Marton\u2019s region [1] for a DM-BC. We then deﬁne two partial order broadcast conditions, interference-oblivious less noisy and interference-cognizant less noisy. Under these conditions, a reduced form of R is shown to be equivalent to the region based on a simpler scheme that uses only superposition coding at the broadcast transmitter. Furthermore, if interference is strong for the interference-oblivious less noisy DM-BIC, the capacity region is given by the aforementioned two equivalent rate regions. Interestingly, for the interference-cognizant less noisy DM-BIC, we argue that the strong but not very strong interference condition does not exist and in this case, we obtain the capacity region for the very strong interference.\nThis paper is organized as the follows. The channel model is introduced in Section II, followed by the derivation of R in Section III. For the DM-BIC with two partial order broadcast conditions, the equivalence of rate regions is presented in Section IV and the capacity regions are derived in Section V. This paper is concluded in Section VI.\nNotation : Let φ denote a constant. Due to space limit, all the proofs, otherwise stated, are relegated to the full version of this paper [10].\nA discrete memoryless broadcast interference channel is denoted by (X 1 × X 2 , p (y 1 , y 2 , y 3 |x 1 , x 2 ), Y 1 × Y 2 × Y 3 ), where X i , i = 1, 2, are the input alphabets, Y j , j = 1, 2, 3, are the output alphabets and p (y 1 , y 2 , y 3 |x 1 , x 2 ) is the chan- nel transition probability. In this paper, we concentrate on a speciﬁc interference proﬁle, where p (y 1 , y 2 , y 3 |x 1 , x 2 ) = p (y 1 |x 1 )p(y 2 |x 1 , x 2 )p(y 3 |x 2 ). As shown in Fig 1, while trans- mitter 1 wishes to broadcast to receivers 1, 2 , the second receiver is interfered by transmitter 2 who wishes to commu- nicate with receiver 3.\nDeﬁnition 1: A (M 1 , M 2 , M 3 , n ) code consists of message sets W j = {1, ..., M j }; two encoding functions X 1 : (W 1 ×\nW 2 ) → X n 1 , X 2 : W 3 → X n 2 and three decoding functions g j : Y n j → W j , j = 1, 2.3.\nThe messages W j are uniformly from W j . The average error probability for the (M 1 , M 2 , M 3 , n ) code is\nDeﬁnition 2: Rates of a (M 1 , M 2 , M 3 , n ) code are deﬁned as R j = log 2 (M j ) n for j = 1, 2, 3.\nRates (R 1 , R 2 , R 3 ) are said to be achievable if there exists a sequence of (M 1 , M 2 , M 3 , n ) codes with P e → 0 as n → ∞. An achievable rate region is the set of all achievable rates for a given coding scheme. The capacity region is the closure of the union of all achievable rate regions.\nIn this section, we derive an achievable rate region for a general DM-BIC, where the broadcast transmitter employs rate splitting, superposition coding and binning and the interfering transmitter employs rate splitting.\nTheorem 1: R is an achievable rate region for a DM-BIC, where R is the closure of all (R 1 , R 2 , R 3 ) satisfying\nProof: The detailed proof is relegated to [10]. Here we provide a sketch. The messages for receivers 1, 2 are split into common and private parts respectively. Common messages are carried by the cloud signal U 1 , which is decoded at both Y 1\nand Y 2 . The private message carriers V 1 , V 2 , which are only decoded at their respective intended receivers and treated as noise elsewhere, are superimposed upon U 1 , where binning is used to allow arbitrary dependence between V 1 and V 2 . At the interfering transmitter, rate splitting is employed to alleviate interference by receiver 2 decoding the common signal U 2 while treating the private as noise.\nRemark 1: Constraint (4) on the choice of joint input distributions is a direct consequence of the nonnegativity of some intermediate rates, which are eventually eliminated using Fourier-Motzkin procedure.\nRemark 2: With U 1 = V 1 = φ, X 1 = V 2 and R 1 = 0, R reduces to the compact Han-Kobayashi region [13] for a one- sided interference channel. With X 2 = U 2 = φ and R 3 = 0, R reduces to the most general form of Marton\u2019s region with private message sets for a general DM-BC [11]. Notice that with U 2 = φ, the constraint (4) reduces to\nwhich applies to Marton\u2019s region. However a closer ex- amination reveals that (5) is unnecessary. For some joint distribution that violates (5), we have R 1 , R 2 ≤ I, where I = min{I(U 1 ; Y 1 ), I(U 1 ; Y 2 )}. Clearly (R 1 , R 2 ) is contained in Marton\u2019s region for some other joint distribution that satisﬁes (5). Therefore removing constraint (5) does not really enlarge the region.\nHere we concentrate on the DM-BIC under two partial order broadcast conditions: interference-oblivious less noisy and interference-cognizant less noisy, which will be deﬁned next.\nDeﬁnition 3: In a DM-BIC, receiver 2 is said to be interference-oblivious less noisy than receiver 1, denoted by Y 1 ≺ o Y 2 , if I (U 1 ; Y 1 ) ≤ I(U 1 ; Y 2 ) for all p(u 1 , x 1 )p(x 2 ) such that U 1 → (X 1 , X 2 ) → (Y 1 , Y 2 ).\nDeﬁnition 4: In a DM-BIC, receiver 1 is said to be interference-cognizant less noisy than receiver 2, denoted by Y 1 ≻ c Y 2 , if I (U 1 ; Y 1 ) ≥ I(U 1 ; Y 2 |X 2 ) for all p(u 1 , x 1 )p(x 2 ) such that U 1 → (X 1 , X 2 ) → (Y 1 , Y 2 ).\nRemark 3: We can interpret Y 1 ≺ o Y 2 as the follows: receiver 2 is less noisy than receiver 1 [4], even though no particular action is taken by receiver 2 to deal with interfer- ence. Similarly, Y 1 ≻ c Y 2 can be interpreted as the follows: even if interference X 2 is provided to receiver 2, receiver 1 is still less noisy. Also note that degradedness (physical or stochastic, which are the same in broadcast channel [12, Theorem 15.6.1]) implies the partial order conditions and hence is stricter. For example, Y 2 being degraded with respect to Y 1 , i.e. X 1 → Y 1 → Y 2 holds for all p (x 1 , x 2 ), implies Y 1 ≻ c Y 2 , but not vice versa.\nThe ﬁrst class of schemes we consider is a specialization of R, given in the following two corollaries.\nCorollary 1: R 1 is an achievable rate region for a DM-BIC with Y 1 ≺ o Y 2 , where R 1 is the closure of all (R 1 , R 2 , R 3 ) satisfying\nCorollary 2: R 2 is an achievable rate region for a DM-BIC with Y 1 ≻ c Y 2 , where R 2 is the closure of all (R 1 , R 2 , R 3 ) satisfying\nRemark 4: Fixing time-sharing r.v. Q = φ, R i , i = 1, 2, are obtained by specializing R with X 1 = V 2 , V 1 = U 1 , and with X 1 = V 1 , V 2 = U 1 , respectively. It can be shown that time-sharing does not enlarge R i . Consequently, convex hull operation is also unnecessary.\nNext we present two achievable rate regions, R (i) , i = 1, 2, which are solely based on superposition coding (i.e. no rate splitting at the broadcast transmitter), where the cloud center carries only receiver i\u2019s message. Since the proofs are stan- dard, they are omitted for conciseness.\nTheorem 2: R (1) is an achievable rate region for a DM-BIC with Y 1 ≺ o Y 2 , where R (1) is the closure of all (R 1 , R 2 , R 3 ) satisfying\nTheorem 3: R (2) is an achievable rate region for a DM-BIC with Y 1 ≻ c Y 2 , where R (2) is the closure of all (R 1 , R 2 , R 3 ) satisfying\nIn deriving the most general region R, we used rate splitting, superposition coding and binning at the broadcast transmitter. Regions R i , i = 1, 2, are derived from R when binning is stripped off but rate splitting and superposition\nkept intact. While both R i and R (i) rely on superposition coding, there is a subtle difference. Despite the fact that both schemes\u2019 cloud centers carry receiver i\u2019s message, the one for R i could also carry receiver j\u2019s (j = i, j = 1, 2) common message, which could be potentially helpful to reduce the self- interference due to the fact that part of the broadcast signal intended for receiver j is essentially interference from receiver i\u2019s perspective. It is apparent that the superposition-only-based rate regions are not larger than the ones based on superposition and rate splitting, since the latter includes the former as a special case. This can be also veriﬁed by explicitly checking that the inequalities deﬁning R (i) induce those in R i , but not vice versa. Hence at ﬁrst sight it seems that R i is strictly larger than R (i) . However, if we consider the no interference case, i.e. U 2 = X 2 = φ, R 3 = 0, R i cannot be strictly larger than R (i) since the latter is the capacity region of a less noisy (or degraded) DM-BC [11]. The pitfall of the previous argument is that it only considers a speciﬁc input distribution. It is true that for some given P U 1 ,X 1 ,U 2 ,X 2 , R i is strictly larger, however once we consider all P U 1 ,X 1 ,U 2 ,X 2 , we will show that they are indeed equivalent.\nTo illustrate the idea, here we only prove R 2 = R (2) . The proof of R 1 = R (1) is similar but technically more involved and is left to [10]. Before proving Theorem 4, we need the following deﬁnitions and lemmas.\nDeﬁnition 5: Let R n c be a convex subset of R n , a n- dimensional Euclidean space. A point X ∈ R n c is an extreme point (ExP) iff whenever X = tY + (1 − t)Z, t ∈ (0, 1) and Y = Z, this implies either Y ∈ R n c or Z ∈ R n c .\nDeﬁnition 6: An ExP X ∈ R n c is said to be dominant (DExP) iff there does not exist another ExP Y ∈ R n c , Y = X, such that X ≤ Y element-wise.\nRemark 5: In the literature, the term \u201cdominant extreme points\u201d are sometimes referred as corner points. The intention of choosing the former terminology is to emphasize the connection to convex set.\nLet R n be a n-dimensional convex rate region, of which the set of all DExPs is denoted by Ω. Further let co(Ω) denote the convex hull of Ω:\nLemma 1: R ∈ R n iff there exists some R \u2032 ∈ co(Ω) such that R ≤ R \u2032 element-wise.\nLemma 1 suggests that a rate region is completely described by its DExPs. When comparing different rate regions, it sufﬁces to consider their sets of DExPs, which will be given in the follows for R 2 and R (2) .\nLemma 3: For a P U 1 ,X 1 ,U 2 ,X 2 , R (2) has two DExPs A, B as in Lemma 2.\nProof of Theorem 4: Let P = P U 1 ,X 1 ,U 2 ,X 2 and P U i =φ denote the same distribution except U i = φ. From Lemma 2 and 3, for a given P, R 2 has two more DExPs than R (2) . However, for P U 1 =U 2 =φ , A becomes A \u2032 = ( I(X 1 ; Y 1 ), 0, I(X 2 ; Y 3 ) ) and it can be shown C, D ≤ A \u2032 due to Y 1 ≻ c Y 2 . Therefore if we take the union of regions for the two distributions P and P U 1 =U 2 =φ , both R 2 and R (2) will have identical DExPs. By Lemma 1, R 2 = R (2) .\nIn this section, capacity regions of a DM-BIC with Y 1 ≺ o Y 2 and Y 1 ≻ c Y 2 are established respectively for the strong and very strong interference conditions deﬁned in the following.\nDeﬁnition 7: Interference is said to be strong if for all p (x 1 )p(x 2 ), I(X 2 ; Y 2 |X 1 ) ≥ I(X 2 ; Y 3 ).\nDeﬁnition 8: Interference is said to be very strong if for all p (x 1 )p(x 2 ), I(X 2 ; Y 2 ) ≥ I(X 2 ; Y 3 ).\nRemark 6: The intuition behind these deﬁnitions, which are the same as the regular interference channel [14], is that by conditioning on the intended signal, whose decoding is assured to be successful by design, the interfered receiver sees a better channel than interference\u2019s own receiver. This suggests that the interfered receiver should be able to decode the interference along with its intended signal, by performing a joint decoding if interference is strong. If further interference is very strong, successive interference cancellation decoding sufﬁces, where interference is decoded ﬁrst. Evidently very strong condition is stricter than the strong condition.\nTheorem 5: The capacity region of a DM-BIC with Y 1 ≺ o Y 2 and the strong interference condition is the closure of all (R 1 , R 2 , R 3 ) satisfying\nRemark 7: The capacity region takes two different forms. The one given in Theorem 5 is identical to R (1) with U 2 = X 2 . An alternative form is given by R 1 with U 2 = X 2 .\nWhen receiver 2 is interference-oblivious less noisy than receiver 1, for any sensible coding scheme X 1 should always\nbe decodable at receiver 2 (otherwise, none of the broadcast receivers can do so). Hence the strong condition, originated from interference channel, naturally carries over to a DM-BIC with Y 1 ≺ o Y 2 . However, this is not the case for a DM-BIC with Y 1 ≻ c Y 2 , which will be discussed next.\nTheorem 6: The capacity region of a DM-BIC with Y 1 ≻ c Y 2 and the very strong interference condition is the closure of all (R 1 , R 2 , R 3 ) satisfying\nProof: The achievability follows those for R (2) and R 2 , all with with U 2 = X 2 . The converse proof is standard.\nRemark 8: Similarly to Theorem 5, the capacity region takes two forms, one given in Theorem 6, which is essentially R (2) with U 2 = X 2 , and another given by R 2 with U 2 = X 2 .\nIt is not difﬁcult to see that strong condition in Deﬁnition 7 does not ﬁt well for a DM-BIC with Y 1 ≻ c Y 2 . The reason is that if X 1 is the intended signal for receiver 2, i.e. if X 1 is always decodable at receiver 2, then by Y 1 ≻ c Y 2 , receiver 1 can decode it as well. Hence the two receivers will always decode the same set of messages, which clearly does not represent the most general case. In fact, we claim that the strong but not very strong interference condition does not exist for a DM-BIC with Y 1 ≻ c Y 2 . The argument is as the follows.\nThe problem is to ﬁgure out what is the intended signal for receiver 2. Once we ﬁnd out such a signal, we can mimic the strong condition in Deﬁnition 7, with modiﬁcation of conditioning on that signal instead of X 1 . Suppose there exists some strong condition, then interference X 2 is required to be decoded at receiver 2. Under this restriction, we have an upper bound n (R 2 + R 3 − ǫ n ) ≤ I(W 2 , W 3 ; Y n 2 ). Along with other straightforward upper bounds, by the same technique that we used above to prove Theorem 5, we can show that R (2) with U 2 = X 2 is the capacity region. This implies that if there exists some strong condition, then superposition coding with cloud center U 1 carrying receiver 2\u2019s message is capacity achieving. Hence without loss of generality, we can view the cloud center U 1 as the intended signal for receiver 2, which in return gives us the strong condition I (X 2 ; Y 2 |U 1 ) ≥ I(X 2 ; Y 3 ), for all p (u 1 )p(x 1 |u 1 )p(x 2 ) such that U 1 → (X 1 , X 2 ) → (Y 2 , Y 3 ) form a Markov chain. However, this condition always implies the very strong condition (consider U 1 = φ) and furthermore the strong interference capacity region, R (2) with U 2 = X 2 , always reduces to the very strong capacity region given in Theorem 6. In other words for Y 1 ≻ c Y 2 , if interference is strong, then it has to be very strong.\nIn this paper, we devise a coding scheme combining rate splitting, superposition coding and binning for a general DM- BIC. The obtained achievable rate region is then specialized to the DM-BIC under two partial order broadcast conditions:\ninterference-oblivious less noisy and interference-cognizant less noisy. By carefully inspecting the dominant extreme points, the specialized rate region is shown to be equivalent to that based on a simpler scheme that uses only superposition coding at the broadcast transmitter. For the interference- oblivious less noisy DM-BIC, if interference is strong, the capacity region is given by the aforementioned two equivalent rate regions. For the interference-cognizant less noisy DM- BIC, we argue that the strong but not very strong interference condition does not exist and in this case, we obtain the capacity region for very strong interference.\nTo prove the converse, we use the technique proposed in [15]. Speciﬁcally, we need the following lemma that can be easily proved using the same arguments for [15, Lemma 1].\nLemma 4: In a DM-BIC with Y 1 ≺ o Y 2 , if W → (X n 1 , X n 2 ) → (Y n 1 , Y n 2 ) form a Markov chain, then the following holds:\nThe achievable schemes are given by the coding schemes for R 1 in Corollary 1 and R (1) in Theorem 2 respectively, all with U 2 = X 2 .\nFor the converse, we deﬁne U i = (W 1 , Y i− 1 1 ). For some ǫ n such that lim n→∞ ǫ n = 0, by Fano\u2019s inequality, we have\nNow we consider upper-bound for R 2 +R 3 . The strong con- dition implies I (X n 2 ; Y n 2 |X n 1 ) ≥ I(X n 2 ; Y n 3 ), [14, Lemma]. Proceeding,\nwhere (b) is due to the strong condition and (c) is due to Lemma 4.\nFinally, we have n (R 3 − ǫ n ) ≤ n i =1 I (X 2,i ; Y 3,i ). The proof is complete by redeﬁning U = (U Q , Q ), X j,i = X j for j = 1, 2, and Y l,i = Y l , for l = 1, 2, 3, where Q is a uniformly distributed r.v. on (1, ..., n)."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"K.
