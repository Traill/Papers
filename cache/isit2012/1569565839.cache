Later the research in this area was stimulated by the signiﬁcant relation to the following topics in computer science: coding theory, sequences and cryptography (design of stream ciphers and S-boxes for block ciphers). Kumar, Scholtz and Welch in [1] generalized the notion of Boolean bent functions to the case of functions over an arbitrary ﬁnite ﬁeld. Complete classiﬁcation of bent functions looks hopeless even in the binary case. In the case of generalized bent functions, things are naturally much more complicated. However, many explicit methods are known for constructing bent functions either from scratch or based on other, simpler bent functions.\nGiven a function f (x) mapping F p n to F p , the direct and inverse Walsh transform operations on f are deﬁned at a point by the following respective identities:\nwhere Tr n () : F p n → F p denotes the absolute trace function, ω = e 2πi p is the complex primitive p th root of unity and elements of F p are considered as integers modulo p.\nAccording to [1], f (x) is called a p-ary bent function (or generalized bent function ) if all its Walsh coefﬁcients satisfy |S f (b)| 2 = p n . A bent function f (x) is called regular (see [1, Deﬁnition 3] and [2, p. 576]) if for every b ∈ F p n the normalized Walsh coefﬁcient p −n/2 S f (b) is equal to a complex p th root of unity, i.e., p −n/2 S f (b) = ω f ∗ (b) for some function f ∗ mapping F p n into F p . A bent function f (x) is called weakly regular if there exists a complex u having unit magnitude such that up −n/2 S f (b) = ω f ∗ (b) for all b ∈ F p n . For a weakly regular function f , function f ∗ is called the dual of f . Recently, weakly regular bent functions were shown to be useful for constructing certain combinatorial objects such as partial difference sets, strongly regular graphs and association schemes (see [3], [4], [5]). This justiﬁes why the classes of (weakly) regular bent functions are of independent interest.\nAll known univariate polynomials representing inﬁnite classes of p-ary bent functions are listed in the table below. Here ξ denotes a primitive element of F 3 n , r and wr refer to regular and weakly regular bent functions respectively. The ﬁrst eight families in the table are monomials of the form Tr n (ax d ) while the last two are binomial bent functions in the form Tr n (F (x)). Also, for any a ∈ F p n , deﬁne the Kloosterman sum K(a) = x∈F\nw Tr n (x+ax −1 ) , where w is a complex p-th primitive root of unity. These functions were constructed and analyzed in [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13].\nDeﬁnition 1: A class of bent functions is complete if it is globally invariant under the action of the general afﬁne group and under the addition of afﬁne functions. The completed class of a set S of bent functions is the smallest possible complete class of bent functions which includes S.\nThe following construction called Maiorana-McFarland gives by far the widest class (denoted M) of bent functions, compared to all the other primary constructions. In the binary case, the completed class of M contains all quadratic bent functions which are the simplest and best understood. How- ever, this does not hold in the generalized case. First, for p odd there exist quadratic bent functions over F p n when n is odd\nwhile Maiorana-McFarland bent functions are deﬁned only for n even. For the case n even, we provide examples of quadratic generalized bent functions not belonging to the completed class M. Moreover, it turns out that almost all of the known classes do not intersect with the completed class M. This leads us to the conclusion that in general, the Maiorana-McFarland construction is less overall than in the binary case even for the case n even.\nand any function σ : F m p → F p . Then f : F m p × F m p → F p with f (x, y) := x · π(y) + σ(y) is a bent function. Moreover, the bijectiveness of π is necessary and sufﬁcient for f being bent. Such bent functions are regular and the dual function is equal to f ∗ (x, y) = y · π −1 (x) + σ(π −1 (x)).\nThe criterion for a function to be a member of the completed class of M is known in its binary version when p = 2 (see [14]). In the general case, the proof is similar and we skip it here.\nProposition 1: For an even n, if a bent function f : F p n → F p belongs to the completed class of M then there exists an n/2-dimensional vector subspace V in F p n such that the second order derivatives\nIn the following section, we prove that all non-quadratic cases of p-ary bent functions listed in the table above do not belong to the completed class of M. We also show that in contrast to the binary case, the completed class M does not cover all quadratic bent functions.\nTheorem 1: The bent function f (x) = Tr n (x d + x 2 ) over F p n , where n = 4k and d = p 3k + p 2k − p k + 1, does not belong to the completed class of M.\nProof: Assume that f is EA-equivalent to a function from class M. Then there exists a 2k-dimensional vector space V ⊂ F p 4k such that the second order derivative of f\nvanishes for any a, b ∈ V . Clearly D a,b f equals the sum of the second order derivative of Tr n (x 2 ), which is constant and equals 2Tr n (ab), and the second order derivative of Tr n (x d ).\nwhere t 0 , t 3k ∈ {0, 1}, t k , ..., t 2k−1 ∈ {0, 1, ..., p − 1}. In Tr n ((x + a + b) d − (x + a) d − (x + b) d + x d ) the coefﬁcient of the monomial x t with\nis (a + b) p 3k +1 − a p 3k +1 − b p 3k +1 = a p 3k b + ab p 3k . Indeed, the numbers t p i mod (p n − 1), 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, are cyclic shifts of the vector t , and it is easy to note that t = t p i mod (p n − 1), 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. It is also obvious that, any cyclic shift of any vector t, t = t , of the form (2) is different from t .\nIf D a,b f ≡ 0 for some a, b = 0 then all coefﬁcients of the monomials in D a,b f must equal 0, and, in particular, we get for the coefﬁcient of x t\nIf there exists a 2k-dimensional vector space V such that D a,b f ≡ 0 for all a, b ∈ V then D a,a f ≡ 0 for all a ∈ V , and therefore 2a p 3k +1 = 0 by (3), a contradiction which shows that V cannot exist.\nTheorem 2: The ternary bent function f (x) \t = Tr n (ξ 3k +1 4 x d ) over F 3 n , where k = n/2 ≥ 3 is odd, d = 3 n −1 4 + 3 k + 1 and ξ is primitive in F 3 n , does not belong to the completed class of M.\nAssume there exists an n/2-dimensional vector space V ⊂ F 3 n such that\nvanishes for any a, b ∈ V . Let k be odd. In (x + a) d all the monomials have the form x t with\nwhere t 1 , t k ∈ {0, 1}, t 2i ∈ {0, 1, 2}, 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1. Among them we choose t = 0 2 ...0 2 0 0 , that is, in t we take t 1 , t k = 0, t 2i = 2, 1 ≤ i ≤ k−1. It is easy to see that t = t p i mod (p n − 1), 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1 and that, any cyclic shift of any vector t, t = t , of the form (4) is different from t . Therefore, in Tr n ξ 3k +1 4 (x + a + b) d − (x + a) d − (x + b) d + x d\nthe coefﬁcient of the monomial x t is ξ 3k +1 4 (a + b) 3 k +3 − a 3 k +3 − b 3 k +3 = ξ 3k +1 4 a 3 k b 3 + a 3 b 3 k . If D a,b f ≡ 0 then all coefﬁcients of the monomials in D a,b f must equal 0, and in particular choosing a = b we get 2ξ 3k +1 4 a 3 k +3 = 0 for any a ∈ V , a contradiction which shows that V cannot exist, and therefore, f does not belong to the completed class of M.\nTheorem 3: The ternary bent function f (x) = Tr n (cx d ) over F 3 n , where c ∈ F ∗ 3 n , d = 3 k +1 2 with gcd(k, n) = 1 and 3 ≤ k ≤ n is odd, does not belong to the completed class of M.\nAssume that f is EA-equivalent to a function from class M. Then there exists an n/2-dimensional vector space V ⊂ F 3 n such that\nvanishes for any a, b ∈ V . In (x + a) d all the monomials have the form x t with\nwhere t 0 ∈ {0, 1, 2}, t 1 , ..., t k−1 ∈ {0, 1}. In D a,b f the coefﬁcient of the monomial x t with\nc a 3 k−1 b 3 k−2 + a 3 k−2 b 3 k−1 . Indeed, the numbers t p i mod (p n − 1), 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, are cyclic shifts of the vector t , and it is easy to note that t = t p i mod (p n − 1), 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. It is also obvious that, any cyclic shift of any vector t, t = t , of the form (5) is different from t .\nIf D a,b f ≡ 0 for some a, b = 0 then all coefﬁcients of the monomials in D a,b f must equal 0, and, in particular, the coefﬁcient c a 3 k−1 b 3 k−2 + a 3 k−2 b 3 k−1 of x t is 0. If there exists a 2k-dimensional vector space V such that D a,b f ≡ 0 for all a, b ∈ V then D a,a f ≡ 0 for all a ∈ V , and therefore 2ca 3 k−1 +3 k−2 = 0, a contradiction.\nTheorem 4: The bent function f (x) = Tr n (cx 2 ) over F p n , where c ∈ F p n and n = 2k, belongs to the completed class of M if the equation (cx 2 ) p k −1 = −1 has solutions. In particular, f belongs to the completed class of M if c p k −1 = −1.\nProof: Let u ∈ F p 2k . Then for any a, b ∈ u F p k we get a = ua , b = ub for some a , b ∈ F p k , and\nIf u is a solution for the equation (cx 2 ) p k −1 = −1 then cu 2 + (cu 2 ) p k = 0 and therefore D a,b f vanishes for any a, b ∈ u F p k . In particular if c p k −1 = −1 then D a,b f vanishes for any a, b ∈ F p k .\nNote 1: The bent function Tr n (cx 2 ) is not in the completed class of M on F p n for p = 3, 5, 7, 11 and n = 4, when c ∈ F ∗ p n is not a squire. Actually in these ﬁelds the proposition above can be stated as \u201dif and only if\u201d claim.\nTheorem 5: The bent function f (x) = Tr n (cx d ) over F 3 n , where n = 2k ≥ 6, d = t(3 k − 1) with gcd(t, 3 k + 1) = 1, and c ∈ F 3 n with K(c 3 k +1 ) = 0, does not belong to the completed class of M when t = 3 i + w for some nonnegative i and 0 ≤ w ≤ 2.\nProof: We just sketch the proof here since it is similar to the ones of Theorems 1-3. We can assume without loss of generality that 0 ≤ i ≤ k − 1.\nLet ﬁrst w = 0. Then we can assume that i = 0. We have d = 3 k − 1 = 2(3 k−1 + 3 k−2 + ... + 1) = 0 ... 0\nIn (x + a) d all the monomials are of the type x t with t = ( 0 ... 0 t k−1 ... t 0 ) where t 0 , ..., t k−1 ∈ {0, 1, 2}. Let t = 0 ... 0\nmod (p n − 1), 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1 and that any cyclic shift of any vector t, t = t , of the form above is different from t . Hence x t has the coefﬁcient 4a 4 in (x + a) d , and therefore it has coefﬁcient 4c((a + b) 4 − a 4 − b 4 ) = 4c(ab 3 + a 3 b) in D a,b f . If D a,a f ≡ 0 for some a ∈ F ∗ 3 n then a 4 = 0, a contradiction.\nmonomial x t has the coefﬁcient c((a+b) 3 k+i +3 i −a 3 k+i +3 i − b 3 k+i +3 i ) = c(a 3 k+i b 3 i + a 3 i b 3 k+i ) in D a,b f . If D a,a f ≡ 0 for some a ∈ F ∗ 3 n then a 3 k+i +3 i = 0, a contradiction.\nsee that the monomial x t has the coefﬁcient c((a + b) 3 i +1 − a 3 i +1 − b 3 i +1 ) = c(ab 3 i + a 3 i b) in D a,b f . If D a,a f ≡ 0 for some a ∈ F ∗ 3 n then a 3 i +1 = 0, a contradiction."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"P. V. Kumar"},{"name":"R. A. Scholtz"},{"name":"L. R.
