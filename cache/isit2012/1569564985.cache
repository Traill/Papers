A function f : F p r → F p r is called a planar function if for every a ∈ F ∗ p r the function ∆ f a : x → f (a + x) − f (x) is a bijection.\nAn equivalent deﬁnition of a planar function involves the ability to construct an afﬁne plane [6, §5], which is where the name planar originates. It is known that planar functions do not exist on ﬁelds of characteristic 2 [6, §5].\nTwo orthonormal bases B 1 and B 2 of C d are unbiased if | x|y | = 1 √ d for all x ∈ B 1 and y ∈ B 2 . A set of bases for C d which are pair- wise unbiased is a set of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs). This idea is credited to Schwinger [14] who realised that a quantum system prepared in a basis state from B reveals no information when measured with respect to the basis B. Mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) are an important tool in quantum information theory and have applications in quantum cryptography [2], [13] and quantum state tomography [16].\nWe highlight two different constructions of mu- tually unbiased bases for odd prime power integers,\none which uses a polynomial of degree 3 but only works for ﬁnite ﬁelds of characteristic p ≥ 5 [9, Theorem 1]. This construction is a generalisation of low correlation complex sequences ﬁrst constructed by Alltop [1] for spread spectrum radar and com- munication applications.\nThe other construction uses a polynomial of degree 2, which is a planar function, to construct the vectors in a complete set of MUBs (see Thm 1) [12], [9]. In contrast, the Alltop construction of complete sets of MUBs (Thm 2 [1], [9]) uses a function, f (x) = x 3 which is not planar, but for which the difference function ∆ f a (x) is planar. We aim to discover if x 3 is the only polynomial function with this property.\nTheorem 1 (Planar function construction). [12, Thm 4.1] Let F q be a ﬁeld of odd characteristic p. Let Π(x) be a planar function on F q . Let V a := {v ab : b ∈ F q } be the set of vectors\nwith a, b ∈ F q . The standard basis E along with the sets V a , a ∈ F q , form a complete set of q + 1 MUBs in C q .\nThe property that is being exploited in the planar function construction is that [4, Theorem 16]\nTheorem 2 (Alltop Construction). [9, Thm 1] Let F q be a ﬁnite ﬁeld of odd characteristic p ≥ 5 and let V a := {v ab : b ∈ F q } be the set of vectors\nwith a, b ∈ F q . The standard basis E along with the sets V a , a ∈ F q , form a complete set of q + 1 MUBs in C q .\nAlthough on the surface the Alltop construction does not use a planar function, when inspecting the inner product of the vectors,\nwe notice a polynomial of degree 2. Now Π(x) = x 2 is a planar function, and equation (2) ensures that a set of MUBs has been constructed. Thus if we take f (x) = (x + b) 3 then ∆ f d (x) is a planar function. The question that arises is whether f (x) = (x + b) 3 is the only function of this type:\nQuestion 3. Is f (x) = x 3 the only polynomial function on a Galois ﬁeld such that ∆ f a (x) is a planar function?\nTwo sets of MUBs, B = {B 0 , B 1 , . . . , B d } and C = {C 0 , C 1 , . . . , C d }, written as matrices, are equivalent [3, App A] if either B or B ∗ is equal to {U C 0 D 0 P 0 , U C 1 D 1 P 1 , . . . , U C d D d P d } for some\nunitary matrix, U , unitary diagonal matrices, D i , and permutation matrices, P i .\nGodsil and Roy [8] have shown that the Alltop construction produces MUBs that are equivalent to the set of MUBs constructed using Π(x) = x 2 in the Planar function construction, which naturally leads to the following question:\nQuestion 4. If another function exists such that ∆ f a (x) is planar, will the sets of MUBs con- structed be equivalent?\nAny function which meets the criteria of Ques- tion 3 will hence forth be called an Alltop type function.\nDeﬁnition 5. An Alltop type polynomial is a polynomial, f , such that for each a ∈ F ∗ q\nWe investigate Question 3 establishing that All- top type functions cannot exist on ﬁelds of charac- teristic 3, and show that for the class of planar functions of the form Π(x) = x p k +1 with p a prime, f (x) = x 3 is the only Alltop type function.\nWe begin with some preliminary results con- cerning polynomials. The following properties of binomial expansions will be used in calculating ∆ f a (x).\nLemma 6. [15, Prop. 8] Let n = a i p i and k = b i p i with 0 ≤ a i , b i ≤ p. Then p n k if and\nLemma 7. [15, Cor 19.1] If p s |n and (k, p) = 1, then p s | n k .\n= 0 (mod p) if k ∈ {0, 1, p s , p s + 1} = 0 (mod p) if 2 ≤ k ≤ p s − 1\n(7) p s + 2\np s + 1, p s + 2} = 0 (mod p) if 3 ≤ k ≤ p s − 1\nUsing these preliminary facts, we can calculate a few properties of ∆ f a (x) when f is a monomial. Lemma 11. Let F q be a ﬁeld of characteristic p and f (x) = x n with n = p s , where s ≥ 0. Then ∆ f a (x) is constant for all a ∈ F ∗ q .\na i x n−i . By Lemma 8 p| n k for all k ∈ {1, . . . , p s − 1} hence (x + a) n − x n is constant.\nTheorem 12. Let F q be a ﬁeld of characteristic p and f (x) = x n with n = p s m where s ≥ 0, m > 1 and (m, p) = 1. Then ∆ f a (x) has degree p s (m−1) for all a ∈ F ∗ q .\nProof: Let f (x) = x n then by the Taylor\u2019s expansion ∆ f a (x) = n i=1 n i a i x n−i . We need to show that the ﬁrst non-zero coefﬁcient in this binomial expansion is n p s .\nWe start with s = 0. Then n and p are co-prime and n p s = n 1 = n which is not divisible by p.\nLet i = p k t for 1 ≤ k < s and (p, t) = 1, t ≥ 1. By Lemmas 7 and 10,\np k t − 1 \t (10) = 0 (mod p). \t (11)\nSince m and p s are co-prime, m = j i=0 a i p i where a 0 ≥ 1. Hence n = p s m = s+j i=s a i−s p i , whereas p s = 1.p s + i=s 0 × p i . Using Lemma 6 we ﬁnd that p n p s . Thus ∆ f a (x) has degree p s (m − 1).\nCorollary 13. Let a ∈ F ∗ p r . If ∆ f a (x) ∈ F p r [x] has degree p s l, where (l, p) = 1 and 0 ≤ s ≤ r, then\nwhere at least one of b t ∈ F ∗ p r , and g(x) is such that ∆ ga (x) is of degree less than p s l.\nProof: From Theorem 12, if f has degree p t m then ∆ f a (x) has degree p t (m − 1).\np t (m − 1) =p s l \t (12) m =p s−t l + 1. \t (13)\nThus the possible monomials f for which ∆ f a (x) has degree p s l are of degree p t (p s−t l + 1) where 0 ≤ t ≤ s.\nLemma 14. [5] Let L(x) and L (x) be additive permutation polynomials, and M (x) an additive polynomial on a ﬁeld F of characteristic p. Let Π (x) = L (Π(L(x)))+M (x)+δ. If Π is a planar function on a ﬁeld F, then Π is also a planar function on F for all δ ∈ F.\nThe functions Π and Π are considered equiva- lent [4]. For a ﬁeld of characteristic p, an additive polynomial has the shape\nThe families of planar functions are speciﬁed by conditions on the degree of the monomials which make up Π. Hence we are only considering L(x), L (x) to have degree 1. Any polynomial on F q may be reduced modulo x q − x to yield a\npolynomial of degree less than q which induces the same function on F q [5]. Hence we only consider polynomials of degree less that q.\nWith the aid of the preceding facts about poly- nomial expansions, we show that no Alltop type functions exist in ﬁelds of characteristic 3, and that a speciﬁc class of planar functions has a unique Alltop type function.\nA more recent and extensive list of planar func- tion can be found in [11]. New planar functions are continually being discovered. The results presented here are not an exhaustive investigation, but show some promising directions for future work.\nIt is known that planar functions do not exist in ﬁeld of characteristic 2 [6]. We show that Alltop type functions cannot exist in a ﬁeld of characteristic 3.\nTheorem 15. There are no Alltop type polynomials over F 3 r .\n∆ f a (x) =f (x + a) − f (x) \t (15) ∆∆ f ab (x) =f (x + a + b) − f (x + b) − f (x + a)\n∆∆ f 11 (x) =f (x + 2) + 2f (x + 1) + 2f (x + 1) + f (x) \t (18)\n∆∆ f 11 (0) =f (2) + f (1) + f (0), \t (20) ∆∆ f 11 (1) =f (0) + f (2) + f (1), \t (21)\nHence ∆∆ f 11 (x) is not a permutation polynomial, ∆ f 1 (x) is not a planar function, and f is not an Alltop type polynomial.\nThis is of particular importance since while new planar functions are continually being discovered, half of the known classes of planar functions exist only on ﬁelds of characteristic 3 [11]. On the other hand, the relative known abundance of planar functions on ﬁelds of characteristic 3, may be more a product of the ease of search, than the rarity of planar functions on ﬁelds of higher characteristic.\nTheorem 16. [7] Let Π 1 (x) = x p k +1 on F p r , where p is an odd prime, k ≥ 0 is an integer and\nis an odd integer. Then Π 1 (x) is a planar function.\nThis includes x 2 is a special case. We now show that a cubic is the only Alltop type polynomial for this class of planar functions, conditional that p = 5.\nTheorem 17. Let Π 1 (x) = x p k +1 on F p r , where k ≥ 0 is an integer and \t r gcd(r,k) is an odd integer. If for each a ∈ F ∗ p r there exist α a , β a , δ a ∈ F p r , an additive polynomial M a (x) and a polynomial f a (x) such that,\nthen p ≥ 5 and f a (x) is equivalent to a polynomial of degree 3.\nProof: Theorem 15 shows that p ≥ 5. The proof proceeds by establishing a set of possible degrees for f , and eliminating all possibilities other than 3. For ease of notation let α a = α, β a = β, δ a = δ, M a (x) = M (x), and f a (x) = f (x).\nIt is assumed that ∆ f a (x) = αΠ 1 (x + β) + M (x) + δ. Since αΠ 1 (x + β) + M (x) + δ has a term of degree p k + 1, and hence by Corollary 13 f has a term of degree p k + 2.\nConsider a general polynomial function f (x) of degree n; f (x) takes the form f (x) = n i=0 a i x i , with a i ∈ F p r . That is, f can be written as the sum of monomials f i (x) = a i x i of degree i or equivalently f (x) = n i=0 f i (x). Hence\nIt follows that the degree of ∆ f i ,a (x) is less than or equal to p k +1 for all i. Each of these monomials can be treated separately, with an argument similar to that presented below.\nLet f n = x n where n = p s m and gcd(p, m) = 1, and ∆ f n ,a (x) is of degree p k + 1. By Theorem 12, the degree of ∆ f n ,a (x) is p s (m − 1), and we know the degree of Π 1 is p k + 1, so we require\nThere are three cases to consider, k, s ≥ 1, k = 0 or s = 0.\nCase 1: If k, s ≥ 1, p|p s (m − 1) but p |(p k + 1) leading to a contradiction.\ns = 0 and m = 3, which implies p ≥ 5 as already shown. This is the Alltop function.\nCase 3: If s = 0, we assume k ≥ 1 and search for solutions for n when for some i f i (x) has degree p k + 2 thus\nwith g(x) a polynomial function such that ∆ ga (x) is of degree p k or less. By assumption\nOn the other hand, using equation 24 and Corol- lary 9 we get\n∆ f a (x) =(x + a) p k +2 − x p k +2 + ∆ ga (x) =2ax p k +1 + a 2 x p k + a p k x 2\nBy comparing the coefﬁcient of the x p k +1 terms in equations 25 and 26 we ﬁnd that\nIf ∆ ga (x) has degree p k , then by Corollary 13, g(x) = k r=0 b r x p r (p k−r +1) + h(x) where h(x) is a polynomial such that ∆ ha (x) is a polynomial of degree p k −1 or less. Let b = k r=0 p k +p r p r b r a p r .\n∆ f a (x) =(x + a) p k +2 − x p k +2 + ∆ ga (x) (28) =2ax p k +1 + (a 2 + b )x p k\nThere exits an additive polynomial M in equation (23) that can equate the coefﬁcients of any term of the x p i terms in equations (25) and (29).\nNote that equation (25) has no x 2 term but equation (29) does. Hence the coefﬁcient of the x 2 term in ∆ ha (x) must be nonzero, and must cancel with the x 2 term already present in equation (29).\nHowever, we note that all the higher order terms are in agreement, hence all such terms in ∆ ha (x) must have zero coefﬁcients implying ∆ ha (x) has\ndegree 2, and consequently h(x) is equivalent to a polynomial of degree 3. Thus let h(x) = tx 3 + ux 2 + M (x) + w where M (x) is an additive polynomial. Equation (26) becomes\n+ ∆ M a (x) \t (30) Note that t, u, ∈ F p r and are ﬁxed for f (x).\nThe coefﬁcient of the x 2 term in equation (30) is p k +2 2 a p k + 3ta while in equation (25) the coefﬁcient of x 2 is zero. Thus\nIn equation (31) p, k and t are ﬁxed and a can take any value in the ﬁeld. Under the given assumptions,\na p k −1 = a p k −1 \t (32) for all a, a ∈ F ∗ p r , hence\nfor all a ∈ F ∗ p r . Consequently x p k +2 ≡ x 3 , and x 2p k ≡ x 2 . Note that equation 33 implies that k = 0 or r divides k. Hence f is equivalent to a polynomial of degree 3 which is already shown to be a valid solution in case 2.\nWe have shown that for a speciﬁc family of Planar functions, a cubic is the only Alltop type polynomial. We have also shown that Alltop type functions cannot exist on ﬁelds of characteristic 3, which means that Alltop type functions cannot exist for many classes of planar functions.\nNew planar polynomials are continually being discovered. Thus investigating the existence of Alltop type polynomials for all classes of planar function cannot yet be completed. However many of the newly discovered planar functions are on ﬁelds of characteristic 3. So perhaps the possible solution space is not expanding so rapidly.\nThe question of the existence of another Alltop type polynomial is still open. As is the question of whether any Alltop type polynomial would produce a set of MUBs which are non-equivalent to the corresponding planar function MUBs.\nThanks are due to the referees who noted sim- pliﬁcations in the proof of Theorem 17.\nThis work was partially supported by an Aus- tralian Mathematical Society Lift-Off fellowship."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"O.
