Due to the sparseness of the parity check matrices, LDPC codes are efﬁciently decoded by the belief propagation (BP) decoder. Optimized LDPC codes can exhibit performance very close to the Shannon limit [2]. Davey and MacKay [3] have found that non-binary LDPC codes can outperform binary ones.\nFinite ﬁeld of the order 2 m is denoted by F 2 m . For a non- negative integer m 3 and ﬁnite ﬁeld F 2 m4 , the set of m 3 × m 3 invertible matrices over F 2 m4 , i.e., F m 3 ×m 3 2 m4 , is called general linear group and denoted by GL(m 3 , F 2 m4 ). It is known that the decoding complexity of non-binary LDPC codes over general linear group GL(m, F 2 ) is larger than that of non- binary LDPC codes over ﬁnite ﬁeld F 2 m for m ≥ 2. On the other hand, the decoding error rates in the waterfall region for optimized non-binary LDPC codes over general linear group is lower than those for optimized non-binary LDPC codes over ﬁnite ﬁeld [4]. However, no methods to lower the decoding error rates in error ﬂoors for non-binary LDPC codes over general linear group have been proposed. Moreover, the decoding error rates in the error ﬂoor region for optimized non-binary LDPC codes over general linear group have not been compared with those for optimized non-binary LDPC codes over ﬁnite ﬁeld.\ncodes over ﬁnite ﬁeld. In this paper, we deﬁne non-binary LDPC codes over general linear group GL(m 3 , F 2 m4 ) and give BP decoding algorithm for non-binary LDPC codes over GL(m 3 , F 2 m4 ) to analyze the non-binary LDPC codes over both ﬁnite ﬁeld F 2 m and general linear group GL(m, F 2 ). We assume the q-ary memoryless symmetric (q-MS) channels [6] for the generality of the channels, where q = 2 m 1 . We extend the optimization and analysis method in [5] to the non-binary LDPC codes over general linear group transmitted over the q- MS channel. More precisely, ﬁrst, we derive the condition for successful decoding of zigzag cycle codes. Next, we propose a method to lower the decoding error rates in the error ﬂoors for non-binary LDPC codes over GL(m 3 , F 2 m4 ). Moreover, we show lower bounds on the symbol error rates in the error ﬂoors for non-binary LDPC codes over GL(m 3 , F 2 m4 ). Furthermore, some simulation results show that the lower bounds on symbol error rates in the error ﬂoors are tight for the optimized non- binary LDPC codes.\nThis paper is organized as follows: Section II deﬁnes non- binary LDPC codes and introduces the q-MS channel. Section III proposes a method to lower the error ﬂoors by analyzing the zigzag cycles. Section IV derives lower bounds for symbol error rates in the error ﬂoors for non-binary LDPC codes. We omit several proofs in this paper due to space limitation.\nIn this section, we recall the 2 m 1 -MS channel [6] and deﬁne the non-binary LDPC codes over GL(m 3 , F 2 m4 ). A. Non-binary LDPC code over GL(m 3 , F 2 m4 )\nFor the non-binary LDPC codes, the Tanner graphs are represented by sparse bipartite graphs with variable nodes, check nodes and labeled edges. Each labels for the non- binary LDPC codes over GL(m 3 , F 2 m4 ) is an element in GL(m 3 , F 2 m4 ). Let N and M be the number of variable nodes and check nodes, respectively. We denote the label in the edges adjacent to the v-th variable node and the c-th check node, by h c,v ∈ GL(m 3 , F 2 m4 ). To simplify the notation, h c,v = 0 if the v-th variable node and the c-th check node are not connected. Deﬁne [a, b] := {n ∈ N | a ≤ n ≤ b} for the\nintegers a, b. Note that [a, b] = ∅ if a > b. For a given Tanner graph, the code represented by the Tanner graph is given by {(x i ) i ∈[1,N] ∈ (F m 3 2 m4 ) N | N i=1 h j,i x i = 0 ∈ F m 3 2 m4 , j ∈ [1, M]}, where (x\n) i ∈[1,N] represents the vector (x 1 , . . . , x N ). Since the non-binary LDPC codes over F m = GL(1, F 2 m )\nand over GL(m, F 2 ) are special case for the non-binary LDPC codes over GL(m 3 , F 2 m4 ), we refer the non-binary LDPC codes over GL(m 3 , F 2 m4 ) as generalized non-binary LDPC codes.\nIn this paper, we consider the q-MS channel, where q = 2 m 1 . For the 2 m 1 -ary channel, the number of input alphabet X is 2 m 1 . We assume X = F m 1 2 . Let Y be a given continuous (or discrete) alphabet. We denote the channel transition probability by p(y | x), where x ∈ X and y ∈ Y. The q-ary memoryless channel is symmetric if there exists a function T : Y ×X → Y satisﬁed the following properties:\n2) For all x 1 , x 2 ∈ X and y ∈ Y, p(y | x 1 ) = p(T (y, x 2 − x 1 ) | x 2 ) holds.\n3) For channels whose output alphabet Y is continuous, the mapping T is that its Jacobian is equal to 1.\nIn the case for m 1 = 1, 2 m 1 -MS channel represents memory- less binary input output symmetric channel.\nLet α be a primitive element F 2 m4 . Once a primitive element of α is ﬁxed, each element in F 2 m4 is given by an m 4 -bit representation [7, p. 110]. Hence, γ ∈ F m 3 2 m4 is represented by m 3 m 4 bits as (γ i ) i ∈[1,m 3 m 4 ] . Let (x i ) i ∈[1,N] ∈ (F m 3 2 m4 ) N denote a codeword of a non-binary LDPC code. The codeword (x i ) i ∈[1,N] is represented as a binary codeword (x i,j ) i ∈[1,N],j∈[1,m 3 m 4 ] . We assume m 1 | m 3 m 4 and denote m 2 = m 3 m 4 /m 1 . Then, a symbol x i ∈ GL(m 3 , F 2 m4 ) is represented as m 2 channel inputs to 2 m 1 -MS channel. For a given codeword, we denote the channel outputs by\nExample 1: The 2 m 1 -ary symmetric channel (2 m 1 -SC) is an example of the 2 m 1 -MS channel. For the 2 m 1 -SC, the output alphabet is Y = 2 m 1 and transition probability function is\n1 − , \t x = y, /(2 m 1 − 1), x = y,\nwhere is referred as channel error probability. C. BP decoder\nBP decoding proceeds by sending messages along the edges in the Tanner graph. The messages arising in the BP decoder for LDPC codes over GL(m 3 , F 2 m4 ) are vectors of length 2 m , where m = m 3 m 4 . Let Ψ ( ) v,c (resp. Φ ( ) c,v ) be the message from the v-th variable node (resp. c-th check node) to the c-th check node (resp. v-th variable node) at the -th iteration.\n1) Initialization: Set = 0. Recall that N and M denote the number of variable nodes and check nodes in a Tanner graph, respectively. For v ∈ [1, N], let C v = (C v (x)) x ∈F m3 2m4 denote the initial message of the v-th variable node. For γ ∈\nF m 3 2 m4 , the element of initial message C v (γ) is given from the channel output as follows:\nLet N c (c) (resp. N v (v)) be the set of the positions of the variable nodes (resp. check nodes) connecting to the c -th check node (resp. v-th variable node). Set Φ (0) c,v =\n2 −m , 2 −m , . . . , 2 −m for all c ∈ [1, M] and v ∈ N c (c). 2) Iteration:\na) Variable node action: The message Ψ ( ) v,c is given by the component-wise multiplication of the initial message C v and the incoming messages Φ ( ) c ,v from check nodes whose positions c are in N v (v), i.e., for x ∈ F m 3 2 m4\nb) Check node action: The convolution of two vectors Ψ 1 and Ψ 2 is given by\nΨ 1 (y)Ψ 2 (z) is the sum of Ψ 1 (y)Ψ 2 (z) over all y, z ∈ F m 3 2 m4 such that x = y + z. Deﬁne i ∈[1,k] Ψ i := Ψ 1 ⊕ Ψ 2 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Ψ k .\nRecall h c,v is the label of the edge adjacent to the c-th check node and the v-th variable node. The message Φ ( +1) c,v is given as, for x ∈ F m 3 2 m4\n3) Decision: Deﬁne arg max\nD ( ) v (x). For v ∈ [1, N], let ˆx ( ) v be the de- coding output of the v-th variable node. Deﬁne D ( ) v := arg max\nD ( ) v (x). If |D ( ) v | = 1, the decoding output ˆx ( ) v is the element of D ( ) v . If |D ( ) v | > 1, the decoder chooses ˆx ( ) v ∈ D ( ) v with probability 1/|D ( ) v |.\nThe v-th symbol is eventually correct [8] if there exists L v such that for all > L v , ˆx ( ) v = 0. The symbol error rate is deﬁned by the fraction of the symbol which is not eventually correct.\nThe following lemma shows that all-zero codeword assump- tion holds for non-binary LDPC code over GL(m 3 , F 2 m4 ) transmitted over the 2 m 1 -MS channel under BP decoding.\nLemma 1: For non-binary LDPC codes over GL(m 3 , F 2 m4 ) transmitted over 2 m 1 -MS channel under BP decoding, the symbol error probability is independent of the transmitted codeword.\nA zigzag cycle is a circuit [9] such that the degrees of all the variable nodes in the circuit are two. A zigzag cycle of weight w consists of w variable nodes of degree two. The zigzag cycle code is deﬁned by a Tanner graph which forms a single zigzag cycle. Figure 1 shows a zigzag cycle code of symbol code length w. In this section, we give a condition for successful decoding of the zigzag cycle codes over the 2 m 1 -MS channels under BP decoding.\nWe consider the zigzag cycle code of symbol code length w with labels h 1,1 , h 1,2 , . . . , h w,w , h w,1 ∈ GL(m 3 , F 2 m4 ) as shown in Fig. 1. We deﬁne χ := h −1 1,1 h 1,2 · · · h −1 w,w h w,1 .\nDeﬁnition 1: Let χ be the cyclic subgroup generated by χ , i.e., χ := {χ j | j = 0, 1, 2, . . . }. The relation ∼ on F m 3 2 m4 deﬁned by x ∼ y is an equivalence relation on F m 3 2 m4 , if and only if there exists g ∈ χ such that gx = y. The equivalence class of x ∈ F m 3 2 m4 under this relation is χ x = {gx | g ∈ χ }, and is called the orbit of x under χ . The set of orbits of x ∈ F m 3 2 m4 \\ {0} under χ forms a partition of F m 3 2 m4 \\ {0}, i.e., every element in F m 3 2 m4 \\ {0} belongs exactly one of equivalence classes. A set of class representatives ˜\nis a subset of F m 3 2 m4 \\ {0} which contains exactly one elements from each equivalent class.\n:= A 1 A 2 · · · A k . The following theorem shows that the decoding error rates depend on a set of class representatives ˜\nS χ , i.e., the matrix χ ∈ GL(m 3 , F 2 m4 ), for a ﬁxed channel and weight of zigzag cycle code.\nTheorem 1: We consider a zigzag cycle code of sym- bol code length w labeled by h 1,1 , h 1,2 , . . . , h w,w , h w,1 ∈ GL(m 3 , F 2 m4 ) transmitted over the 2 m 1 -MS channel. Let ι i := h −1 i,i h i,i+1 for i ∈ [1, w], where h w+1,w := h 1,w . The matrix χ is given by χ = w i=1 ι i ∈ GL(m 3 , F 2 m4 ). Deﬁne ˜ S χ as in Deﬁnition 1. In the limit of large , all the symbols in the zigzag cycle code are eventually correct under BP decoding if and only if for all x ∈ ˜ S χ ,\nMoreover, in the limit of large , no symbols in the zigzag cycle code are eventually correct under BP decoding if and only if there exists x ∈ ˜ S χ such that\nCorollary 1: Deﬁne S χ as in Deﬁnition 1. For a given channel output, if the zigzag cycle with the matrix χ such that |S χ | > 1 is successfully decoded, the zigzag cycle with the matrix χ such that |S χ | = 1 is also successfully decoded.\nCorollary 1 shows a condition for lowering the error ﬂoor. The following lemma asserts that the condition for successful decoding in the case for | ˜ S χ | = 1 is simpliﬁed by the order of the matrix χ.\nLemma 2: The order of the matrix χ is 2 m 3 m 4 − 1 if and only if | ˜ S χ | = 1. We use the following lemma in order to prove Lemma 2.\nLemma 3: The characteristic polynomial f χ (x) of the ma- trix χ ∈ GL(m 3 , F 2 m4 ) is deﬁned by det(xI − χ) with I being m 3 × m 3 identity matrix over F 2 m4 . For polynomials f (x) over F 2 m4 such that f(0) = 0, the least positive integer e for which f(x) divides x e −1 is called the order of polynomial f (x) and is denoted by ord(f). If the order σ χ of the matrix χ is 2 m 3 m 4 −1 , then the order ord(f χ ) of the characteristic polynomial f χ (x) is also 2 m 3 m 4 −1 .\nProof: Since χ is m 3 ×m 3 nonsingular matrix, f χ (0) = 0. By the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, f χ (χ) = 0. The deﬁni- tion of the order ord(f χ ) of polynomial f χ gives f χ (x) | x ord(f χ ) − 1. Since f χ (χ) | χ ord(f χ ) − 1 and f χ (χ) = 0, we have χ ord(f χ ) − 1 = 0. Hence, we get σ χ | ord(f χ ). Since ord(f χ ) ≤ 2 m 3 m 4 − 1 by [10, Corollary 3.4], ord(f χ ) = 2 m 3 m 4 − 1 if σ χ = 2 m 3 m 4 − 1.\nProof: Denote m = m 3 m 4 . Firstly, we assume | ˜ S χ | = 1. We denote the ﬁrst column of χ j , by χ j 1 . Since | ˜ S χ | = 1,\nF m 3 2 m4 \\ {0} = {χ j (1, 0, 0, . . . , 0) T | j ∈ [0, 2 m − 2]} = {χ j 1 | j ∈ [0, 2 m − 2]}.\nThis equation asserts that χ i 1 = χ j 1 for all i, j ∈ [0, 2 m − 2] with i = j. Hence, χ i = χ j for all i, j ∈ [0, 2 m − 2] with i = j . Thus, the order of χ is equal to or greater than 2 m − 1. For all χ ∈ GL(m 3 , F 2 m4 ), the order of χ is equal to or lower than 2 m − 1, i.e., σ χ ≤ 2 m − 1 [11, Corollary 2]. Therefore, σ χ = 2 m − 1 if | ˜ S χ | = 1.\nSecondly, we assume σ χ = 2 m −1 . By Lemma 3, the order of characteristic polynomial f χ (x) is 2 m − 1. Since ord(f χ ) = 2 m − 1, f(0) = 0 and f(x) is monic polynomial [10, Deﬁnition 1.49], the characteristic polynomial f χ (x) is a primitive polynomial [10, Theorem 3.16]. Hence, the ﬁeld F 2 m is represented in {0} ∪ {χ i | i ∈ [0, 2 m − 2]}. Thus, for all i, j ∈ [0, 2 m − 2] with i = j, there exists a k ∈ [0, 2 m − 2] such that χ i + χ j = χ k . This implies that χ i 1 = χ j 1 for all i, j ∈ [0, 2 m − 2] with i = j. Therefore, | ˜ S χ | = 1 since F m 3 2 m4 \\ {0} = χ (1, 0, . . . , 0) T .\nDiscussion 1: By combining Corollary 1 and Lemma 2, we see that the zigzag cycles with the matrix χ such that the order of χ is 2 m 3 m 4 − 1 have the best decoding performance. By using this condition, we propose a method to lower the error ﬂoors for generalized non-binary LDPC codes as follows: Designing the labels in the zigzag cycles of small weight as the order of χ satisfy 2 m 3 m 4 − 1.\nThe log-likelihood ratio for 2 m 1 -ary channels are deﬁned in [12]. For γ ∈ F m 1 2 , let Z v,i (Y v,i , γ) denote the log-likelihood ratio corresponding to the i-th channel output y v,i in the v-th variable node, i.e.,\n. \t (1) By using the log-likelihood ratio, the following corollary\ngives the condition for successful decoding of the zigzag cycle codes with the matrix χ of the order 2 m 3 m 4 − 1 over the 2 m 1 - ary input memoryless symmetric channel.\nCorollary 2: We consider the zigzag cycle codes of symbol code length w with the matrix χ of the order 2 m 3 m 4 − 1 over the 2 m 1 -ary input memoryless symmetric channel. For γ ∈ F m 1 2 , let Z v,i (Y v,i , γ) deﬁne as in (1). In the limit of large , all the symbols in the zigzag cycle code are eventually correct if and only if\nMoreover, in the limit of large , no symbols in the zigzag cycle code are eventually correct if and only if\nWe deﬁne distributions of log-likelihood ratios associated with the 2 m 1 -ary channels as follows:\nLet a denote the conditional probability density function of the random variable L(Y ) given that the corresponding channel input is zero. We refer the function a as L-density. Note that in the case for the memoryless binary-input output-symmetric channels, i.e., m 1 = 1, L-density deﬁned in the above gives the deﬁnition of the L-density in [13, p. 178].\nDeﬁnition 2: For a L-density a, the Bhattacharyya func- tional B( a) is deﬁned as B(a) := ∞ −∞ a(x) exp[−x/2]dx.\nIn this deﬁnition, we assume not only symmetric L-density [13] but also asymmetric L-density. The following facts show the properties of the Bhattacharyya functional.\nFact 1: For L-density a 1 and a 2 , B( a 1 ∗ a 2 ) = B (a 1 )B(a 2 ) holds, where ∗ denotes the convolution, i.e., (a 1 ∗ a 2 )(x) := ∞ −∞ a 1 (x − y)a 2 (y)dy.\nFact 2: Let Z denote the random variable with L-density a. Then, Pr(Z ≤ 0) ≤ B(a).\nFact 1, 2 and Corollary 2 give the decoding error probability of zigzag cycle with the matrix χ of the order σ χ as the following corollary.\nCorollary 3: Denote m = m 3 m 4 . Let P zz (w, m, a) be the symbol error rate for the zigzag cycle codes deﬁned over GL(m 3 , F 2 m4 ) of symbol code length w with the matrix χ\nsuch that σ χ = 2 m − 1, over the 2 m 1 -MS channel with L -density a under BP decoding. Let Z 1 , Z 2 , . . . , Z k denote independent and identically distributed random variables with L -density a. Deﬁne Z (k) := k v=1 Z v . The Bhattacharyya functional is deﬁned in Deﬁnition 2. The symbol error rates of the zigzag cycle codes is given by\nCorollary 3 shows that for a ﬁxed weight w and m = m 3 m 4 , the decoding error rate of the zigzag cycle code does not depend on m 3 or m 4 . In other words, the decoding error rate of the zigzag cycle over general linear group is equal to that of the zigzag cycle over ﬁnite ﬁeld for a ﬁxed weight w and m = m 3 m 4 .\nIn the previous section, we give a condition for the decoding error to the zigzag cycle code. By using this result, in this section, we give lower bounds of the symbol error rates in the error ﬂoors of non-binary LDPC code ensembles over the 2 m 1 -MS channel under BP decoding.\nDeﬁnition 3: Let LDPC(N, GL(m 3 , F 2 m4 ), λ, ρ) denote LDPC code ensemble of symbol code length N over GL(m 3 , F 2 m4 ) deﬁned by Tanner graphs with a degree dis- tribution pair (λ, ρ) [13] and labels of edges chosen ele- ments from GL(m 3 , F 2 m4 ) with equal probability. Let w g ∈ N be an expurgation parameter. The expurgated ensemble ELDPC(N, GL(m\nF 2 m4 ), λ, ρ, w g ) consists of the subset of codes in LDPC(N, GL(m 3 , F 2 m4 ), λ, ρ) which contain no stopping sets of weight in [1, w g − 1]. Let w c ∈ N be an expurgation parameter for labeling in the Tan- ner graph, where w g ≤ w c . Deﬁne expurgated ensemble ELDPC(N, GL(m 3 , F 2 m4 ), λ, ρ, w g , w c , H) as the subset of codes in ELDPC(N, GL(m 3 , F 2 m4 ), λ, ρ, w g ) which contain no zigzag cycles of weight in [w g , w c − 1] with β ∈ H.\nthe zigzag cycle with the matrix χ ∈ H ∗ m 3 ,m 4 . A. Analysis of Error Floors\nIn this section, we analyze the symbol error rates in the error ﬂoors for the expurgated ensembles deﬁned in Deﬁnition 3. The following theorem gives a lower bound on the symbol error rate under BP decoding for the expurgated ensemble ELDPC(N, GL(m 3 , F 2 m4 ), λ, ρ, w g , w c , H ∗ m 3 ,m 4 ).\nTheorem 2: Let P s (ELDPC, a) be the symbol error rate of the expurgated ensemble ELDPC(N, GL(m 3 , F 2 m4 ), λ, ρ, w g , w c , H ∗ m 3 ,m 4 ) over the 2 m 1 -MS channel characterized by its L-density a under BP decoding. Denote m = m 3 m 4 . Deﬁne Z (km) as in Corollary 3. For sufﬁciently large N and B (a) < 1/µ −1/m the symbol error rate is bounded by\nThis theorem derived from Corollary 3. For a given channel and a ﬁxed µ, m, the decoding error rate for the non-binary LDPC code over ﬁnite ﬁeld F 2 m is same as that for the non- binary LDPC code over GL(m\nF 2 m4 ) such that m = m 3 m 4 . B. Simulation Results\nIn this section, we compare the symbol error rate in the error ﬂoor for the expurgated ensemble constructed by our proposed method with that for non-optimized ensemble.\nFigure 2 shows the symbol error rates for the expurgated ensemble transmitted over the binary additive white Gaussian noise channel ELDPC(315, GL(m 3 , F 2 m4 ), x, x 2 , 1, 8, H) for m 3 = 4, m 4 = 1, H = ∅ (GL(4, F 2 ) Random), for m 3 = 4, m 4 = 1, H = H ∗ 4,1 (GL(4, F 2 ) Proposed) and for m 3 = 1, m 4 = 4, H = H ∗ 1,4 (F 2 4 Proposed). The lower bound is derived from (2).\nFigure 3 shows the symbol error rates for the expurgated ensemble ELDPC(315, GL(m 3 , F 2 m4 ), x, x 2 , 1, 8, H) trans- mitted over the 2 4 -SC for m 3 = 1, m 4 = 4, H = ∅ (F 2 4\nRandom), for m 3 = 1, m 4 = 4, H = H ∗ 1,4 (F 2 4 Proposed), for m 3 = 4, m 4 = 1, H = ∅ (GL(4, F 2 ) Random) and for m 3 = 4, m 4 = 1, H = H ∗ 4,1 (GL(4, F 2 ) Proposed). The lower bound is given by (2).\nFrom Figure 2 and 3, we see that the proposed codes exhibit better decoding performance than non-optimized code. The lower bound (2) gives tight lower bounds for the symbol error rates to the proposed codes. Moreover, we see that the decoding performance in the error ﬂoors for optimized codes depend only on the size of m 3 m 4 .\nWe prove the relation between the orbit and the order of general linear group. In this paper, we propose a method to lower the error ﬂoors for non-binary LDPC codes. In this analysis, we see that the optimized non-binary LDPC codes deﬁned over general linear group exhibits have the same decoding performance in the error ﬂoors as those deﬁned over ﬁnite ﬁeld. The non-binary LDPC codes deﬁned over general linear group have more choices of the labels in the edges which satisfy the condition for the optimization.\nThe work of T.
