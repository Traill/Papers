The single-layer version of this network is an interference channel, whose capacity is unknown in general; it is known only in certain special cases, e.g., a class of determin- istic interference channels [2], a class of strong interference channels [3]\u2013[5], a class of degraded interference channels [6]. The degrees of freedom (d.o.f.) characterizations have been found for the interference channel in several different settings, e.g., [7]\u2013[9]. In particular, the sum d.o.f. of a fully connected interference channel is 1 [10]. The interference channel has been studied from an information-theoretic security [11], [12] point of view in several settings, e.g., [13], [14].\nTwo-unicast layered networks have been studied in [15]\u2013 [17] where conditions to achieve only one rate pair have been given. Recently, [1] showed that, if the source-destination pairs are connected, with probability 1, two-unicast layered Gaussian networks can only have three possible values for the sum d.o.f.: 1, 3/2 or 2. To achieve this result, [1] divided all possible network structures into ﬁve sub-classes, A, A , B, B\nWe extend this line of work to include security in addition to reliability for the end-to-end users. In the ﬁrst part of this work, we show that although for cases A and A in [1] the sum d.o.f. is exactly 1, the sum secure d.o.f. can take values 0, 1 and at most countably many other positive values. These values are unknown, but we provide the simplest equivalent channel models whose sum secure d.o.f. give these values. In the second part of this work, we propose schemes to\nachieve 2 sum secure d.o.f. for cases B and B , and 3/2 sum secure d.o.f. for case C. For most cases, some nodes perform cooperative jamming [18] to help increase the secrecy rates of the legitimate users. For the 2 × 2 × 2 interference network [19], we prove that the sum secure d.o.f. is 2 and give the corresponding achievable scheme.\nIn our achievable schemes, in most scenarios, we either ﬁnd a node and utilize it to protect the communication by having it perform cooperative jamming [18] against the unintended receiver, or employ the real interference alignment tool [9] to align the signals at both destination nodes in a desired way. However, in some certain classes of layered networks, such nodes do not exist. To overcome this problem, we use the interference neutralization technique [20] to neutralize the message signal at the unintended destination and even neutral- ize the artiﬁcial noise at the intended receiver to mimic the wiretap channel with cooperative jamming. After discussing all these possibilities, we note that there is still a class of layered wireless networks in which the sum secure d.o.f. is an open problem. Our second contribution is to ﬁnd the simplest equivalent channel model to characterize this class of networks. Under this classiﬁcation, once the equivalent problem is solved, the sum secure d.o.f. of layered networks will be resolved. The sum secure d.o.f. of this class of networks can only take at most a countably many number of values. Therefore, we determine the sum secure d.o.f. for all two-unicast layered networks as countably many possible values by utilizing these canonical networks.\nLet V be the node set and E ⊂ V × V be the edge set. A two-unicast layered network N = (G, L 2 ) is a di- rected graph G = (V, E) with two source-destination pairs\nL 2 = {(s 1 , d 1 ), (s 2 , d 2 ) } ⊂ V × V . The network has a layered structure which means that the node set V can be partitioned into r mutually disjoint subsets V 1 , V 2 , · · · , V r such that V 1 = {s 1 , s 2 }, V r = {d 1 , d 2 } and\nSince each layer has an index, we deﬁne the index function l (v) as the index of the layer containing the node v, i.e., v ∈\nDeﬁnition 1 (Path) A path P v 1 ,v k is an ordered set of nodes {v 1 , v 2 , · · · , v k } provided that (v i , v i+1 ) ∈ E for i = 1, 2, · · · , k − 1. And, we denote u ; v if there exists at least one path P u,v from u to v.\nTwo paths are disjoint provided that the two sets of nodes are disjoint. To avoid the trivial case, we always assume that s 1 ; d 1 and s 2 ; d 2 . In addition, we cannot remove nodes v which do not belong to any path, since we may employ them to perform cooperative jamming.\nDeﬁnition 2 For a subset of nodes S ⊂ V , we denote by G[S] the graph induced by S on G provided that G [S] = (S, E s ) where E s = {(v, u) ∈ E : v, u ∈ S}\nReference [1] deﬁnes interference and manageable interfer- ence as follows:\nDeﬁnition 3 (Interference) For i = 1 or 2, a node v / ∈ P s i ,d i causes interference on P s i ,d i and we write v I ; P s i ,d i if there exist a node u ∈ P s i ,d i such that (v, u) ∈ E and a path P s j ,v such that P s i ,d i and P s j ,v are disjoint.\nTo characterize the interference form another pair, the number of the nodes causing interference is deﬁned as follows:\nDeﬁnition 4 (Manageable interference) Two disjoint paths P s 1 ,d 1 and P s 2 ,d 2 have manageable interference if we can ﬁnd S ⊂ V , such that (P s 1 ,d 1 ∪ P s 2 ,d 2 ) ⊂ S, n 1 (G[S]) = 1 and n 2 (G[S]) = 1.\nAn example two-unicast layered network is shown in Fig. 1. This network has r = 5 layers and two disjoint paths P s 1 ,d 1 = {s 1 , u 1 , u 2 , u 3 , d 1 } and P s 2 ,d 2 = {s 2 , w 1 , w 2 , w 3 , d 2 }. Node t 1 causes interference on P s 2 ,d 2 , since we can ﬁnd w 2 ∈ P s 2 ,d 2 such that (t 1 , w 2 ) ∈ E and a path P s 1 ,t 1 = {s 1 , t 1 } such that P s 1 ,t 1 and P s 2 ,d 2 are disjoint. This implies that n 2 (G[V ]) = 1. It is also easy to see that n 1 (G[V ]) = 1 due to node t 2 . However, if we choose S = V \\{t 1 , t 2 }, then, for the graph\nG [S] induced by S, n 1 (G[S]) = n 2 (G[S]) = 0. By deﬁnition, P s 1 ,d 1 and P s 2 ,d 2 have manageable interference.\nRegarding the channel model, each node v observes the signals through a memoryless additive Gaussian channel, i.e.,\nwhere N v is a zero-mean unit-variance Gaussian noise and X u is the input signal sent from node u provided that the edge (u, v) exists. All the channel gains h v,u in the network are ﬁxed during the communication session and known at all nodes. Channel gains are independently drawn from contin- uous distributions. For the input signal of each node u, we assume that X u satisﬁes an average power constraint P , i.e.,\n1 n\nwhere n is the total number of channel uses and X u (t) is the input signal sent from node u at time t.\nFor each source-destination pair (s i , d i ), the source node s i intends to transmit a message W i from a message set W i to the destination node d i , and keep it secure against d j 1 . For a ﬁxed n, the number of channel uses, we assume that each node in the network is allowed to use any encoding/decoding function. For a ﬁxed but small enough > 0, the rate R i = 1 n log |W i | is achievable if the probability of decoding error at destination d i is smaller than .\nThe rate R i will be the secure communication rate R s i of pair i if it satisﬁes the secrecy constraint, which is deﬁned as follows: For any i = 1 or 2, the uncertainty of message W i , given the observation of the other destination Y n d j , is almost equal to the entropy of the message, i.e.,\nThis deﬁnition implicitly implies that the source nodes trust all the intermediate relay nodes, but the unintended destination node. The sum secure d.o.f. is deﬁned as:\nlog P \t (6) where the supremum is taken over all possible encod- ing/decoding functions at the nodes in the network.\nTheorem 1 (Sum d.o.f. of two-unicast network [1]) For a two-unicast layered Gaussian network where the channel gains are chosen according to independent continuous distributions, with probability 1, D Σ is given by\nA) 1, if N contains a node v whose removal disconnects d i from {s i , s j } and s j from {d i , d j }, for i = 1 or 2,\nA ) 1, if N contains an edge (v 2 , v 1 ) such that the removal of v 1 disconnects d i from {s i , s j } and the removal of v 2 disconnects s j from {d i , d j }, for i = 1 or 2, j = ¯i,\nB ) 2, if N or any sub-network does not contain two disjoint paths P s 1 ,d 1 and P s 2 ,d 2 , but is not in case (A), C) 3/2, in all other cases.\nThe sum d.o.f. capacity result is D Σ = 1 for this case, which is an upper bound for the sum secure d.o.f. To ﬁnd all possible values of sum secure d.o.f., we ﬁrst characterize the penultimate layer V r−1 :\nG 1 = {u ∈ V r−1 : (u, d 1 ) ∈ E and (u, d 2 ) ∈ E} \t (8) G 2 = {u ∈ V r−1 : (u, d 1 ) ∈ E and (u, d 2 ) / ∈ E} \t (9) G 3 = {u ∈ V r−1 : (u, d 1 ) / ∈ E and (u, d 2 ) ∈ E} \t (10) G 4 = {u ∈ V r−1 : (u, d 1 ) / ∈ E and (u, d 2 ) / ∈ E} \t (11)\nSince the last layer V r only contains d 1 , d 2 , it is safe to remove the nodes belonging to G 4 from the network. For the rest of this paper, we assume that the cardinality of the set G 4 is zero, i.e., |G 4 | = 0.\nWe present our results in sub-cases with an ordered series (A 1 , A 2 , · · · ), which implicitly means that A i only contains the setting A i ∩ (∪ i−1 j=1 A j ) c for all i.\nWithout loss of generality, we give the brief idea of the proof for the condition |G 3 | ≥ 1. There exists at least one node u ∈ G 3 . We can utilize node u to cooperatively jam d 2 with average power P . Then, the last hop of the network forms a Gaussian wiretap channel with h 2 d\nP + 1 as the variance of the effective noise at d 2 , which implies that D s,Σ = 1. The same argument can be applied to |G 2 | ≥ 1.\nBy our assumption, the deﬁnition of the setting A 2 is A 2 ∩ A c 1 , which is |G 1 | = 1 and |G 2 | = |G 3 | = 0. First of all, note that |G 2 | = |G 3 | = 0 implies |G 1 | ≥ 1 due to the existence of P s i ,d i . Furthermore, if |G 1 | = 1 and |G 2 | = |G 3 | = 0, this indicates that V r−1 = G 1 = {u} and both edges (u, d 1 ) and (u, d 2 ) exist. Then, the signals observed at d 1 and d 2 are the same except a constant factor and additive Gaussian noises, which implies that D s,Σ must be 0.\nC. Sub-case A 3 : D s,Σ = 1 if |G 1 | ≥ 2 and there exist two distinct nodes u 1 , u 2 ∈ G 1 , s i ; u 1 and s i ; u 2 for i = 1 or 2.\nFirst, note that the combined conditions |G 1 | ≥ 2 and |G 2 | = |G 3 | = 0 imply that the source nodes s 1 and s 2 do not belong to the layer V r−1 , i.e, V 1 = V r−1 and r ≥ 3; otherwise, this is not case A. The achievable scheme is based on interference neutralization [20]:\n\u2022 For a ﬁxed i, the source node s i sends the message signal to its destination.\n\u2022 All the nodes on the two paths P s i ,u 1 and P s i ,u 2 just relay the signal.\n\u2022 The two nodes u 1 and u 2 perform amplify-and-forward with factors α 1 and α 2 , respectively. The values of α 1 and α 2 will be speciﬁed later.\nWe construct the condensed network [1] with three key layers as shown in Fig. 2. Then, the end-to-end transfer matrix T = [T i , T j ] T from s i to d i , d j satisﬁes\n˜ N 1 ˜ N 2\n˜ h i h i,i + α j ˜ h j h i,j α i ˜ h i h j,i + α j ˜ h j h j,j\n˜ N 1 ˜ N 2\nwhere ˜ N 1 and ˜ N 2 are effective dependent noises with ﬁnite variances. They are independent of the message signal.\nWe simply choose α i = 1 and α j = −(˜h i h j,i )/(˜ h j h j,j ). Then, T j = 0, which indicates that the observation Y n d\nat d j and W i are independent, which means I (W i ; Y n d j ) = 0, i.e., the message W i is secure.\nMeanwhile, the probability that d i can decode W i with arbitrarily small probability of error is\nD. Sub-case A 4 : D s,Σ = 1 if there exist two distinct nodes u 1 , u 2 ∈ G 1 and a node w such that w ; u 1 and w ; u 2 .\nFor this setting, we propose the following achievable scheme:\n\u2022 For a ﬁxed i, the source node s i sends the message signal to u ∈ G 1 . All the nodes on the path P s i ,u relay the signal.\n\u2022 u encodes the message according to a wiretap codebook and sends the codeword to d i .\n\u2022 The special node w sends pure Gaussian random noise with average power aP to jam the destination d j through the two nodes u 1 and u 2 . The linear factor a is a constant to coordinate with the nodes in the network such that all the output signals satisfy the power constraint. a depends on the network topology, but not on the power P .\n\u2022 All the nodes on two paths P w,u 1 , P w,u 2 relay the signals. Nodes u 1 and u 2 perform amplify-and-forward with factors α 1 and α 2 , respectively.\nThe idea here is similar to the previous sub-case. However, we carefully choose the factors α 1 and α 2 to neutralize the artiﬁcial noise at the legitimate destination d i . Then, the last hop of this condensed network is equivalent to the two-pair one-sided additive interference channel with dependent ﬁnite variance noise. Since the noises are independent of the input signals, based on the fact that the secrecy capacity depends only on the marginal distribution of X i , Y i and X i , Y j , we conclude that the sum secure d.o.f. is D s,Σ = 1.\nE. Sub-case A 5 : D s,Σ can only be countably many positive values for all other settings in case A.\n\u2022 |G 1 | ≥ 2 and |G 2 | = |G 3 | = 0, which implies that the total number of the layers r ≥ 3.\n\u2022 For each node w ∈ ∪ r−2 i=1 V i , there exists at most one u w ∈ G 1 such that w ; u w .\nWe claim that for this setting the sum secure d.o.f. could only be a strictly positive function of the value |G 1 |. Therefore, D s,Σ can only take at most countably many possible values.\nIt is easy to prove that u i = u j . We denote u = u i = u j . Then, for each other node ˜ u ∈ G 1 , ˜ u = u, we have s i ; ˜u, s j ; ˜u. Besides, these ˜u\u2019s can only send independent signals because for each node w ∈ ∪ r−2 i=1 V i there exists at most one u w ∈ G 1 such that w ; u w .\nThe condensed network is shown in Fig. 3 (a). Due to the Markov chain W i , W j → Y n u → Y n d i , Y n d j , the node u can decode the messages W i and W j with arbitrarily small probability of error, which implies that D s,Σ ≤ 1 in the ﬁrst dashed box of Fig. 3 (b). The bottleneck is the second box, which is a brodcast channel with conﬁdential messages and M independent helpers . Here M = |G 1 | − 1. We denote the sum secure d.o.f. capacity of this channel as f (M ). We claim that the D s,Σ of the original network is f (M ) = min {f (M), 1}. The converse is straight-forward. The achievability of the ﬁrst box is done by time-sharing.\nFinding the function f (M ) is an open problem. However, we know its following properties:\nTherefore, for networks in sub-case A 5 of case A, D s,Σ is a positive function of |G 1 |. And, D s,Σ can only take at most countably many values.\nWe use the same ideas presented in Section III to analyze the networks in case A . The results are shown in Table I. However, there are two differences between case A and A .\nIn contrast to case A, for case A , we cannot conclude that r ≥ 3 if |G 1 | ≥ 2 and |G 2 | = |G 3 | = 0. If r = 2, this layered network is a two-pair two-sided Gaussian interference channel with conﬁdential messages. The sum secure d.o.f. of this network is an open problem, and is denoted as g (0).\nThe other difference is that, if r ≥ 3 and none of the conditions A 1 , A 2 , A 3 and A 4 is satisﬁed, then there are two scenarios. If there exists node u ∈ G 1 such that s 1 ; u and s 2 ; u, we use the f function to characterize the sum secure d.o.f. If such a node does not exist, which means s i and s j \u201cconnect\u201d to different nodes in V r−1 , then we have to deﬁne a new function g, which also takes at most countably many values.\nAs proved in [1], for all the networks belonging to cases B and B , we could either use a simple amplify-and-forward scheme to make the end-to-end transfer matrix diagonal with non-zero diagonal entries, i.e.,\nβ 1 0 0 β 2\nor ﬁnd a 2 × 2 × 2 condensed interference sub-network in the original layered network.\nFor the diagonal end-to-end transfer matrix, the operations of the nodes in the middle layers are either performing amplify-and-forward or keeping silent, so the effective noises are independent of the input signals, and there is no in- formation leakage from the source node to the unintended destination even when the effective noises N ef f i , i = 1 or 2, at d i are dependent. By interference neutralization, for this class of networks, the sum secure d.o.f. is 2.\nThe 2 × 2 × 2 interference channel is a cascade of two fully connected one-hop interference channels. Reference [19] employed interference neutralization and real interference alignment to achieve 2 sum d.o.f. We use the same idea to design the auxiliary random variables for the 2 × 2 × 2\ninterference channel, construct the channel inputs, and show that it can asymptotically achieve 2 sum secure d.o.f. Based on this result, for the 2 ×2×2 condensed interference sub-network in the original layered network, we simply treat all nodes except the nodes belonging to the sub-network as silent nodes and utilize the same achievable scheme. Note that although the equivalent interference sub-network has dependent noise at each node, due to the fact that the noises are independent of the message and have ﬁnite variances, the difference between these two models will not affect the performance in terms of the reliability and security.\nTherefore, in both cases, the upper bound 2 is achievable, i.e., D s,Σ = 2.\nThe converse for this case is D s,Σ ≤ D Σ ≤ 3 2 from [1]. The achievability without secrecy constant is given in [1].\nWe need to modify the achievable scheme to derive a secrecy rate. To this end, we demonstrate our steps in Fig. 4. In the ﬁrst mode, the source pair (s 1 , s 2 ) transmits (W 1 , W 2 ) to destination (d 1 , d 2 ). Clearly, P s 1 ,d 1 and P s 2 ,d\nare disjoint paths with manageable interference, i.e., case B. We can transmit W 1 to d 1 and W 2 to d 2 securely by amplify-and- forward. In the second mode, s 1 transmits a new message W 1 to d 1 and d 2 forwards the message W 2 received in the ﬁrst mode to d 2 .\nThis scheme can achieve 3 2 sum d.o.f., but the messages are not securely transmitted. The reason is that, in the ﬁrst mode, d 2 can receive a mixed signal from w, which contains both W 1 and W 2 . Note that in this condensed network the noises at each node are dependent, but have ﬁnite variances. To transmit message W 1 securely to d 1 against d 2 in the ﬁrst mode: 1) Node d 2 sends pure Gaussian noise with average power P to jam the unintended receiver d 2 . Signals from s 2 via different paths are canceled at d 1 due to the amplify-and- forward scheme. 2) Since the secrecy capacity depends only on the marginal distribution of X s 1 , Y d 1 , Y d 2 , with the help of jamming from d 2 , we can always design a wiretap code achieving 1 secure d.o.f. for the condensed wiretap channel even when the effective noises at d 1 and d 2 are dependent.\nIn this paper, we studied the sum secure degrees of freedom of two-unicast layered wireless networks. We used the setting in [1], i.e., cases A, A , B, B and C, to explore all possible\nvalues of sum secure d.o.f. The major challenge is the cases A and A due to the fact that both destination nodes may decode the messages. To overcome this problem, we classiﬁed layered wireless networks into more detailed sub-cases and in almost all the sub-cases utilized the techniques of cooperative jam- ming and interference neutralization to design an achievable scheme. There is still a scenario where the result is unknown. We provided the simplest equivalent channel models whose sum secure d.o.f. give these values. In all other cases, we proposed modiﬁed schemes to achieve 2 sum secure d.o.f. for cases B and B , and 3/2 sum secure d.o.f. for case C."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"I. Shomoron"},{"name":"A. S.
