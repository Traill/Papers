The study of cognitive networks was inspired by newfound abilities of smart radios to overhear the transmission taking place over the channel and gather information about neighboring devices [3]. The information theoretical study of cognitive networks has so far focused on small networks with a limited number of users and messages. A classical such model is the cognitive interference channel [2]: a channel where two sets of transmitter/receiver pairs communicate over a shared channel, thus interfering with each others\u2019 transmission. One of the encoders in the network has knowledge of only one of the messages to be transmitted \u2013the primary transmitter\u2013 while the other node has knowledge of both messages \u2013the cognitive transmitter. The extra knowledge at the cognitive encoder models a smart and adaptable device that is able to acquire the primary message from previous or simultaneous transmissions. This model has been of great interest in recent years, see [10] and [11] for a summary of the results, and different results are available in the literature. Capacity is known in the \u201cweak\ninterference\u201d regime of [12], a regime where the interference created by the cognitive transmitter at the primary user is negligible and can be treated as noise. In the \u201cvery strong interference\u201d regime of [6] instead, capacity is achieved by having the primary receiver decode the interference created by the cognitive user and strip it from the received signal. Capacity for the Gaussian case is also known in the \u201cprimary decodes cognitive\u201d regime of [8], [11], in which the cognitive message is decoded at both receivers and pre-coded against the interference created by the primary user at the cognitive receiver. Despite of these and other results, available for the cognitive interference channel, capacity is not known in general. Capacity is actually known for a variation of the cognitive interference channel in which the cognitive receiver is required to decode both messages [5]. In this model, it is not necessary for the cognitive encoder to pre-code its message against the primary transmission and this appears to simplify the problem of determining capacity. The difﬁculty in doing so for the cognitive interference channel seems to follow from the pre-coding of the cognitive codewords which hinders the ability of the primary receivers to decode its interfering signal. In the model we consider the primary receiver is required to decode this interfering signal and this provides important insights on the decoding limitations at the primary user.\n\u2022 Sec. II: we introduce the channel model, a variation of the cognitive interference channel in which the primary receiver decodes both messages.\n\u2022 Sec. III: we derive inner and outer bounds to the capacity region. Both bounds are inspired by the cognitive interference channel in the \u201cstrong interference\u201d regime. In this regime the primary decoder can reconstruct the signal received at the cognitive decoder after having decoded its intended message.\n\u2022 Sec. IV: we show the capacity for the semi- deterministic case . In this channel the output at the cognitive decoder is a deterministic function of the channel inputs while the output at the primary receiver is any random function.\n\u2022 Sec. V: we derive the capacity in the \u201cvery strong interference\u201d regime and the \u201cprimary decodes cognitive\u201d\nregime. In the \u201cvery strong interference\u201d regime there is no loss of optimality in having both receivers decode both messages while in the \u201cprimary decodes cognitive\u201d regime binning at the cognitive transmitter achieves capacity.\n\u2022 Sec. VI: we prove the capacity region of the Gaussian case to within a constant gap and a constant factor . That is, we bound the difference between inner and outer bounds as well as the ratio between the two. These two results characterize the capacity region of the Gaussian case at large and small SNR respectively.\nThe Cognitive InterFerence Channel with a Common Cog- nitive Message (CIFC-CCM), as shown in Fig. 1, is obtained from the classical Cognitive InterFerence Channel (CIFC) by requiring the decoding of both messages at the primary receiver. It consists of two transmitter-receiver pairs that ex- change independent messages over a common channel. Trans- mitter i, i ∈ {1, 2}, has discrete input alphabet X i and its re- ceiver has discrete output alphabet Y i . The channel is assumed to be memoryless with transition probability P Y 1 ,Y 2 |X 1 ,X 2 . Encoder 2 wishes to communicate a message W 2 uniformly distributed on W 2 = [1 : 2 N R 2 ] to decoder 2 in N channel uses at rate R 2 . Similarly, encoder 1, wishes to communicate a message W 1 uniformly distributed on W 1 = [1 : 2 N R 1 ] to both, decoder 1 and decoder 2, in N channel uses at rate R 1 . Encoder 1 (i.e., the cognitive user) knows its own message W 1 and that of encoder 2 (i.e., the primary user), W 2 . A rate pair (R 1 , R 2 ) is achievable if there exist sequences of encoding functions\nThe capacity region is deﬁned as the closure of the region of achievable (R 1 , R 2 ) pairs [1]. Standard strong-typicality is assumed; properties may be found in [4].\nIn the following we focus in particular on the Gaussian CIFC-CCM in Fig. 2. For this class of channels the in- put/output relationship is:\nY 1 = X 1 + aX 2 + Z 1 , \t (1) Y 2 = X 2 + |b|X 1 + Z 2 ,\nfor a, b ∈ C and for Z i ∼ N C (0, 1), where the N C indicates complex, circularly symmetric jointly Gaussian random vari- ables (RV). Moreover, the channel inputs are subject to the power constraints\nA channel in which the outputs are obtained as a linear combination of the inputs plus an additional complex Gaussian term and where the inputs are subject to a second moment constraint can be reduced to the formulation in (1) and (2) without loss of generality [11, App. A].\nWe start by deriving an outer bound for the capacity region of the general CIFC-CCM. This outer bound is based on the results known for the cognitive interference channel in the \u201cstrong interference\u201d regime.\nR 1 ≤ I(Y 1 ; X 1 |X 2 ), \t (3a) R 1 ≤ I(Y 2 ; X 1 |X 2 ), \t (3b)\nProof: The outer bound in (3a) was originally devised for the classical CIFC in [12] and is valid for the CIFC-CCM as\nwell, since the cognitive receiver is decoding only the cognitive message. The bound (3b) is obtained from Fano\u2019s inequality as\n≤ ∑ N k=1 H(Y 2,k |X 2,k ) − H(Y 2,k |X 1,k , X 2,k ) ≤ NI(Y 2,Q ; X 1,Q |X 2,Q , Q),\nwhere Q is the time sharing RV, uniformly distributed in the interval {1 . . . N}.\nThe bound (3c) is derived as: N (R 1 + R 2 ) − Nϵ N\nAll the bounds are decreasing in the time sharing RV Q and thus it can be dropped.\nfor all the distributions P X 1 ,X 2 . Condition (4) corresponds to the \u201cstrong interference\u201d regime for the CIFC. When dropping (3b) from the expression in (3), one obtains the \u201cstrong interference\u201d outer bound for the CIFC [6]. This outer bound is capacity in the \u201cvery strong interference\u201d regime for the general CIFC and is capacity in the \u201cprimary decodes cognitive\u201d regime for the Gaussian CIFC.\nRem. III.2 formally deﬁnes the relationship between the CIFC in \u201cstrong interference\u201d and the CIFC-CCM. For a CIFC for which (4) holds, there is no loss of optimality in having the primary receiver decode both messages. For a CIFC-CCM for which (4) holds, the rate of the cognitive message is not bounded by the decoding capabilities of the primary receiver. For these reasons, a CIFC for which (4) holds is equivalent to a CIFC-CCM for which (4) holds. We avoid referring to the condition in (4) as \u201cstrong interference\u201d condition as one cannot properly deﬁne \u201cinterference\u201d in the CIFC-CCM since the primary receiver is decoding both the cognitive message and the primary message.\nThe next theorem specializes the outer bound of Th. III.1 to the Gaussian channel in (1).\nCorollary III.3. An Outer Bound for the Gaussian CIFC- CCM. The outer bound of Th. III.1 for the Gaussian CIFC- CCM reduces to\nR 1 ≤ C(α min{1, |b| 2 }P 1 ), \t (5a) R 1 + R 2 ≤ C(P 2 + b 2 P 1 + 2\nProof: The outer bound is obtained from Th. III.1 by noting that complex, circularly symmetric channel inputs maximize all the rate bounds simultaneously.\nWe now develop an inner bound for the CIFC-CCM as follows: we rate-split the primary message in public and private part. The primary private message is superposed to the public primary message; the cognitive common message is superposed to the primary public message and pre-coded against the primary private message.\nTheorem III.4. Inner Bounds for the CIFC-CCM. The following region is achievable for a general CIFC-CCM\nR 1 ≤ I(Y 1 ; U 1c |U 2c ) − I(U 1c ; X 2 |U 2c ), \t (6a) R 1 ≤ I(Y 2 ; X 1 |X 2 , U 2c ), \t (6b)\nR 1 + R 2 ≤ I(Y 1 ; U 1c , U 2c ) + I(Y 2 ; X 2 |U 1c , U 2c ), (6c) R 1 + R 2 ≤ I(Y 2 ; X 1 , X 2 ), \t (6d)\nProof: The common cognitive message is embedded in the codeword U N 1c , with rate R 1c , while the primary common message is embedded in the codeword U N 2c , with rate R 2c , and the primary private message in the codeword X N 2 , with rate R 2p . The codeword U N 1c is binned against X N 2 and the code- words U N 1c and X N 2 are both superposed to U N 2c . The channel input X N 1 is ﬁnally obtained as a deterministic function of U N 1c , U N 2c and X N 2 . From [7] we obtain the achievable region\n+ I(U 1c ; X 2 |U 2c ), \t (7d) R 1c + R 1c + R 2p ≤ I(Y 2 ; U 1c , X 2 |U 2c )\n+ I(U 1c ; X 2 |U 2c ), \t (7e) R 1c + R 1c \t ≤ I(Y 2 ; U 1c |X 2 , U 2c )\n+ I(U 1c ; X 2 |U 2c ), \t (7f) R 2p ≤ I(Y 2 ; X 2 |U 1c , U 2c )\nThe chain graph representation, see [7] in the proof of Th. III.4, is provided in Fig 3: the blue boxes represent codewords associated with the primary message while the green diamond represents the common cognitive codeword. Solid lines represent superposition coding while dotted lines binning.\nNote that the achievable region in [10, Th. 7] for the CIFC has less bounds than the region in Th. III.4. This follows from\nthe fact that the correct decoding of the cognitive message is not required in the CIFC and some error events in the scheme of Th. III.4 are not errors in the achievable scheme of [10, Th. 7].\nThe semi-deterministic CIFC-CCM is a general CIFC- CCM where the channel output at the cognitive decoder is a deterministic function of the channel inputs, i.e.\nwhile the primary output is any random function of the inputs. When condition (9) holds, binning at the cognitive transmitter can fully pre-cancel the effect of the interference at the cognitive receiver thus making (3a) achievable.\nTheorem IV.1. Capacity of the Semi-Deterministic CIFC- CCM. The capacity of the semi-deterministic channel is\nR 1 ≤ H(Y 1 |X 2 ), \t (10a) R 1 ≤ I(Y 2 ; X 1 |X 2 ), \t (10b)\nProof: Consider the transmission scheme in Th. III.4 for U 2c = ∅ to obtain the region\nR 1 ≤ I(Y 1 ; U 1c ) − I(U 1c ; X 2 ), \t (11a) R 1 ≤ I(Y 2 ; X 1 |X 2 ), \t (11b)\nR 1 + R 2 ≤ I(Y 2 ; X 1 , X 2 ), \t (11c) R 1 + R 2 ≤ I(Y 1 ; U 1c ) + I(Y 2 ; X 2 |U 1c ), \t (11d)\nFor the assignment U 1c = Y 1 , which is possible given (9), the inner bound in (11) coincides with (10) since\nCapacity in the \u201cvery strong interference\u201d regime for the CIFC is achieved by having both receivers decode both messages and by superposing the cognitive message over the primary message [6]. This strategy achieves capacity for a class of CIFC-CCM that we also term \u201cvery strong interference\u201d regime. This deﬁnition is not fully accurate since the primary receiver decodes both messages, but is coherent with the literature.\nTheorem V.1. Capacity in the Very Strong Interference Regime. If\nProof: Consider the scheme in (6). For X 2 = U 2c and U 1c = X 1 the achievable region is\nR 1 ≤ I(Y 1 ; X 1 |X 2 ), \t (15a) R 1 ≤ I(Y 2 ; X 1 |X 2 ), \t (15b)\nR 1 + R 2 ≤ I(Y 1 ; X 1 , X 2 ), \t (15c) R 1 + R 2 ≤ I(Y 2 ; X 1 , X 2 ). \t (15d)\nUnder condition (14) the bound in (15c) can be eliminated from the inner bound and the inner bound is then equivalent to the outer bound in (3).\nRemark V.2. The \u201cvery strong interference\u201d regime for the CIFC is deﬁned by condition (14) and (4). However, condition (4) is not required to prove capacity for the CIFC-CCM.\nThe following corollary states the result of Th. V.1 for the Gaussian case in (1).\nCorollary V.3. Capacity for the Gaussian CIFC-CCM in the \u201cvery strong interference\u201d regime. If\nProof: Condition (16) is derived from (14) for the Gaus- sian model in (1). Details can be found in [11, App. B].\nWe can extend the \u201cprimary decodes cognitive\u201d regime of [11] to the Gaussian CIFC-CCM:\nTheorem V.4. The \u201cprimary decodes cognitive\u201d regime for the Gaussian CIFC-CCM. If\nP 2 |1 − a|b|| 2 ≥ (|b| 2 − 1)(1 + P 1 + |a| 2 P 2 ) − P 1 P 2 |1 − a|b|| 2 , P 2 |1 − a|b|| 2 ≥ (|b| 2 − 1)(1 + P 1 + |a| 2 P 2 + 2Re {a}\n(17) then (5) is the capacity of the Gaussian CIFC-CCM.\nProof: Consider the scheme in (11) with the assignment X i ∼ N(0, P i ) i ∈ {1, 2}, \t (18a)\nThis scheme achieves capacity when (19b) is larger than (19c). The conditions were determined in [11] to prove the \u201cprimary decodes cognitive\u201d regime for the Gaussian CIFC.\nRemark V.5. The \u201cprimary decodes cognitive\u201d regime for the CIFC is deﬁned by condition (17) and condition (4) which is given by |b| ≥ 1 in the Gaussian case. Condition (4) is not required to prove capacity for the CIFC-CCM. The capacity of the Gaussian CIFC-CCM for |b| ≤ 1 is given by Corollary V.4.\nTheorem VI.1. Capacity to within 1.87 bits/s/Hz. For any Gaussian CIFC-CCM, the outer bound region in (5) can be achieved to within 1.87 bits/s/Hz.\nProof: Capacity is known for |b| ≤ 1. The achievability of the outer bound in (5) to within 1.87 bits/s/Hz for |b| > 1 using the scheme in (11) is shown in [9].\nTheorem VI.2. Capacity to within a factor 2. For any Gaussian CIFC-CCM, the outer bound region in (5) can be achieved to within a factor 2.\nProof: Capacity is known for |b| ≤ 1. The achievability of the outer bound in (5) to within a factor 2 for |b| > 1 by a simple time division scheme is shown in [11].\nA plot of the capacity results available for the Gaussian CIFC-CCM is depicted in Fig. 4: in the a × b plane we plot the \u201cstrong interference\u201d regime (green, right-hatched area) and the \u201cprimary decodes cognitive\u201d regime (blue, left-hatched area). \t VII. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper we study a variation of the classical cognitive interference channel where the primary receiver decodes both messages. This channel is related to the cognitive interference channel in the \u201cstrong interference\u201d regime and many results for this channel apply to the model under consideration. We derive the capacity for the semi-deterministic case, where the cognitive output is a deterministic function of the channel inputs. We also show capacity in the \u201cvery strong interference\u201d\nregime, where there is no rate loss in having both receivers decode both messages, and in the \u201cprimary decodes cognitive\u201d regime where binning at the cognitive transmitter achieves capacity. For the Gaussian case we prove capacity to within a constant gap of 1.87 bit/s/Hz and to within a constant factor of two."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"T. Cove"},{"name":"J.
