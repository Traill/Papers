We consider that in addition to the statistics of the main and the eavesdropper channel state information (CSI), the sender is provided by the legitimate receiver with a q-bit feedback, at the beginning of each coherence block, through an error-free feedback channel, with capacity q bits. We establish upper and lower bounds on the secrecy capacity. We show that a positive secrecy rate is achievable even when the feedback is at the end of each coherence block and q = 1.

Schemes based on sending an artiﬁcial noise to enhance the eavesdropper equivocation [5], even when the sender has imperfect CSI, are presented in, e.g., [6], [7]. The secrecy capacity has also been studied using the so-called variational distance as a secrecy criterion in [8].\nIn this paper, we assume that Bob knows its own channel instantaneously and Eve knows both its own channel and the main channel, instantaneously; whereas Alice is only aware of the statistics of these channels. There is also an error-free feedback channel with limited capacity from Bob to Alice that may be tracked by Eve. The secret message capacity of this channel is not known. Several previous works have highlighted the impact of limited-rate feedback on the capacity of fading channels without secrecy constraint (see for instance, [9] and references therein). However, to the best of our knowledge, not much attention has been given to secret message capacity with limited-rate feedback. For the setting described above, we extend the scheme in [3] to incorporate q-bit feedback and observe numerically that when Rayleigh fading channels are considered, a 4-bit feedback achieves 90% of the high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) secrecy capacity when perfect main CSI is available at the transmitter. We also show that even when the feedback is at the end of each coherence block and q = 1, a positive secrecy rate is achievable. This complements a result in [10] where a secret-key generation mechanism with 1-bit feedback at the end of the coherence block is proposed. As q → ∞, we prove that the achievable rate coincides with the secrecy capacity when perfect main channel CSI is available at the transmitter. Finally, we present asymptotic analysis at high-SNR and show that the capacity is bounded and that a simple suboptimal scheme which does not require any numerical optimization, is capacity-achieving, as q → ∞.\nThe organization of this paper is a s follows. Section II describes the system model. Achievable rates with q-bit feedback at the beginning of each coherence block or 1-bit at the end of each coherence block are provided in Section III. High-SNR analysis are reported in Section IV. Section V contains our numerical results, whereas Section VI concludes the paper.\n      \nwhere for convenience, we set R N+1 = ∞. Furthermore, this bound coincides with the secrecy capacity when perfect main channel CSI is available at the transmitter given by [3]:\n2 P (h) 1 + |g| 2 P (h)\nIt is particularly appealing to see that the lower bound in (2) is the sum over all possible rates of the product of the probability of success times the average rates gleaned by Bob over Eve during all fading realizations. A similar fact has been observed in [10], but for secret key sharing (not message transmission) and for N = 1. Theorem 1 states that a 1-bit feedback at the beginning of each coherence block guarantees a positive secrecy rate. Clearly, such a feedback mechanism converts the main channel to a noiseless channel whereas the eavesdropper is still suﬀering an erasure. The lower bound in (2) is an increasing function of N and as shown in the Appendix, the lower and the upper bounds in (2) match as N → ∞, hence fully characterizing the ergodic capacity in this case. Letting N goes to ∞ may be interpreted as if there is a noiseless feedback link with inﬁnite capacity for which the secrecy-key capacity, an upper bound on the secrecy capacity, is given by the right hand side (RHS) of (2) [11], [12]. It is worth mentioning that guaranteeing a positive secrecy rate is not really tied to knowing the feedback at the beginning of each coherence block. Providing a feedback at the end of each coherence block instead, also guarantees a positive secrecy rate, although smaller than the one given by (2). To see this, let us assume that at the end of each coherence block, Bob feeds back a 1-bit ARQ to Alice informing her whether the actual frame has been correctly decoded (ACK), or not (NACK). Alice keeps retransmitting the same block until he gets an ACK, then moves on to the next frame. Clearly, because some of the frames are transmitted more than once, this scheme leaks some information to the eavesdropper. Ultimately, one can assume that the blocks repeated because of the NACK feedback are completely revealed to the eavesdropper as a worst-case sce- nario. Fortunately, even such a not-very sophisticated scheme guarantees a positive secrecy rate as formalized in Theorem 2.\nTheorem 2: A lower bound on the secrecy capacity of the discrete-time memoryless channel described by (1), with an error-free 1-bit ARQ feedback at the end of each coherence\n1 L\nand we are interested in the secrecy capacity at asymptotically high-SNR. Our result is summarized in Corollary 1.\nCorollary 1: At high-SNR, a lower bound on the secrecy capacity C ∞ s is given by:\nwhere F | h| 2 (·) is the cumulative density function of |h| 2 . Furthermore, this bound coincides with the secrecy capacity when perfect main channel CSI is available at the transmitter given by [3]:\nProof: The asymptotic achievable rate follows by adapt- ing the rates R p \u2019s in Theorem 1 with the average power constraint, i.e., R p = log 1 + α p P avg . This set of rates is an eligible candidate provided that 0 ≤ α 1 ≤ . . . ≤ α N . Such a choice gives:\n. (11)\nlog (x) dx = 1; then by the Dominated Convergence Theorem, we have:\nTaking the limits on both sides of (11) as P avg → ∞ and using (12), the lower bound in (9) is established. To show that the upper and the lower bounds coincide as N → ∞, it is suﬃcient to choose α p \u2019s such that F | h| 2 α p+1 − F | h| 2 α p =\n, p = 1, . . . , N. This only requires the sender to know F | h| 2 (·) which she does. This choice of α p \u2019s provides an asymptotic (at high-SNR) achievable rate equal to\n1 N\nNote that to achieve the secrecy rate in (9), the R p \u2019s are adapted with the power as R p = log 1 + α p P avg . Clearly, for\nThe secret message capacity of an ergodic block fading wiretap channels with limited-rate feedback has been ad- dressed. lower and upper bounds have been derived when an arbitrary number of feedback bits at the beginning of each coherence block are provided to the sender by the legitimate receiver, through an error free feedback channel with limited capacity. We also show that a positive secrecy rate is achievable when only 1-bit ARQ feedback is given to the sender at the end of each coherence block. When the number of feedback bits is large enough, the lower and the upper bounds coincide, thus fully characterizing the capacity in this case. A suboptimal strategy that adapts the rate with the power constraint is presented and is shown to be optimal at high-SNR, as the number of feedback bits tends to inﬁnity. Our framework characterizes the value of limited-rate feedback on secret message capacity.\nThe authors would like to thank Dr. Ahmed Sultan for fruitful discussions about [10] of which he is a co-author.\nwhere R i ∈ {0, R 1 , . . . , R N− 1 } is the rate selected in coherence block i.\nnR e = H(W|Z n , h L , g L ) \t (16) ≥ I(W; X n |Z n , h L , g L ) \t (17) = H(X n |Z n , h L , g L ) − H(X n |Z n , h L , g L , W ) \t (18)\n1 L\nThus it only remains to show that the second term satisﬁes H (X n |Z n , h L , g L , W ) ≤ nǫ. We argue that given the message W the eavesdropper can uniquely decode the sequence v and hence the codeword sequence X n . In coherence block i, the eavesdropper constructs a list L i for all codeword sequences that are jointly typical with the received sequence Z(i). From standard typicality analysis there are a total of 2 m (R i −log(1+|g i | 2 P )) such sequences. It then searches for a unique sequence in the set L = L 1 × L 2 · × · L L that belongs to the bin-index of W . The size of this set is: |L| = 2 m L i=1 m [R i −log(1+|g i | 2 P )] + , which from the weak-law of large numbers, approaches 2 n (R s −ǫ) as L → ∞ . Since each sequence in the set L belongs to the bin of W with probability 2 −nR s the overall error probability can be shown to vanish as n → ∞.\nFor the upper bound, we simply reveal the main channel state to Alice at the beginning of each coherence block corresponds to conveying an inﬁnite-bit feedback by Bob. In this case, the upper bound follows from the secrecy capacity with main channel CSI established in [3, Theorem 2]. It remains to show that the lower and the upper bounds coincide as N → ∞. For this purpose, let the R p \u2019s scale with SNR as R p = log 1 + α p P . By this speciﬁc choice, the achievable rate becomes:\n       \nlog 1 + α p P log 1 + |g| 2 P\n       \nAdditionally, let us choose α p \u2019s such that F | h| 2 α p+1 − F | h| 2 α p = 1 N . Note that this is possible\nas long as Alice is aware of the statistics of h which she is. The results follows as N → ∞ due to the ergodicity."},"refs":[]},"file":{"jsonClass":"File","file":"/home/arnfred/Code/trailhead/resources/isit2012/1569566219.pdf"},"links":[],"meta":{"jsonClass":"HashMap$HashTrieMap","sessionid":"S2.T4.2","endtime":"12:10","authors":"Zouheir Rezki, Ashish Khisti, Mohamed-Slim Alouini","date":"1341229800000","papertitle":"On the Ergodic Secret Message Capacity of the Wiretap Channel with Finite-Rate Feedback","starttime":"11:50","session":"S2.T4: Wiretap Channels with Feedback, Side Information, and Common Messaes","room":"Stratton 20 Chimneys (306)","paperid":"1569566219"},"cluster":{"jsonClass":"Map$EmptyMap$"}}
