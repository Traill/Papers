The networks consist of multiple nodes, each of which can be a source, relay, and/or destination.

However, even for a simple three-node relay channels, the capacity is not known yet. In [3], Cover and El Gamal provided the cut-set bound for the relay channel and introduced two coding strategies, decode-and-forward and compress-and-forward, which can achieve the capacities of some relay channels including physically degraded channels. For more complicated networks, a general cut-set bound is provided in [4]. Lately, El Gamal, Hassanpour, and Mammen introduced new types of relay channels in [5], which are casual and noncausal relay channels. Unlike a strictly causal relay, the causal relay\u2019s transmit symbol depends on both the past and the current received symbols and the noncausal relay\u2019s transmit symbol depends on the future symbols as well. These new types of relays are further studied in [6] for noncausal relay channels, and in [7] for causal interference relay channels. Also, a multiple-source and multiple-destination causal relay network is studied in [8].\nIn this paper, we focus on the causal case and characterize an outer bound of the capacity region of a casual DMRN with causal side information. We assume that every nodes can act as a source, relay, and/or destination and they are separated into two types of relays, causal and strictly causal relays. Also, we assume that the channel state is given for some nodes. This is a generalized version of network models with side information in [9], [10]. For this network, we show a cut-set outer bound. Our bound is reduced to the cut-set bound without side information for causal DMRNs [8] and the classical cut-set bound for strictly causal DMRNs [4]. For a causal MIMO fading relay channel with CSI at the relay and destination, we show that a simple amplify-and- forward relaying scheme can achieve the capacity under some\nconditions. The remainder of this paper is organized as follow. In Section II, we introduce our network model. In Section III, the new cut-set bound for causal DMRNs with causal side information is provided and compared to other known bounds. We give some examples of the networks in Section IV and conclude the paper in Section V.\nWe consider a multiple-source multiple-destination causal discrete memoryless relay network with side information con- sisting of K nodes\nwhere the channel state S n \t {S 1 , . . . , S n } for n ≥ 1 is independent and identically distributed according to p(s). This network consists of sender alphabets X k and receiver alphabets Y k , k ∈ [1 : K] {1, 2, . . . , K} and a conditional probability distribution\nwhere N 0S is the set of causal relays with causal side information, N 0N is the set of causal relays without causal side information, N 1S is the set of strictly causal relays with causal side information, and N 1N is the set of strictly causal relays without causal side information, and N 0S ∪ N 0N ∪ N 1S ∪ N 1N = [1 : K]. To avoid inﬁnite loop among causal relays, we assume the received signal of causal relay y k , k ∈ N 0S ∪ N 0N , does not depend on the transmit signal of the causal relays. A (2 nR 11 , 2 nR 12 , . . . , 2 nR KK , n)\ncode for this network consists of K 2 message sets, K en- coders, where encoder k ∈ N 0S assigns an input sym- bol x ki to each (m k1 , . . . , m kK , y i k , s i ), encoder k ∈ N 0N assigns an input symbol x ki to each (m k1 , . . . , m kK , y i k ), encoder k ∈ N 1S assigns an input symbol x ki to each (m k1 , . . . , m kK , y i −1 k , s i −1 ), and encoder k ∈ N 1N assigns an input symbol x ki to each (m k1 , . . . , m kK , y i −1 k ) at time i, where m kj is a message from node k to node j, and K decoders, where decoder k ∈ N 0S ∪ N 1S assigns a set of messages ( ˆ m 1k , . . . , ˆ m Kk ) to each received sequence (y n k , s n ), and decoder k ∈ N 0N ∪ N 1N assigns a set of messages ( ˆ m 1k , . . . , ˆ m Kk ) to each received sequence y n k . Here, ˆ m jk is a decoded message from nodes j to k. We assume that R kk = 0 for all k ∈ [1 : K].\nIn this section, we provide a new cut-set bound for the causal DMRN with causal side information. Then, we compare the bound with other known bounds.\nTheorem 1: If the rates R jk are achievable in the causal DMRN with causal side information, there exists some joint probability distribution\n(1) such that ∑\n X( T ), Y ( U 0S ), Y ( U 0N )\n(2) for the cuts T ⊂ [1 : K] such that V 0S ∪ V 1S ̸= ∅, and ∑\nX(T ), Y (U 0S ), Y ( U 0N ); Y ( V 1N ) Y ( V 0N ), X( V 0N ), X( V 1N )\n(3) for the cuts T ⊂ [1 : K] such that V 0S ∪ V 1S = ∅, where T ∩ N iS = U iS , T ∩ N iN = U iN , T c ∩ N iS = V iS , and\nProof: First, we show the bound (2).

We skip the proof of the bound (3) since it is similar to that of the main theorem in [8].\nNow, we compare the cut-set bound in Theorem 1 with other known cut-set bounds.\nProposition 1: The cut-set bound in Theorem 1 coincides with the cut-set bound for the causal DMRN without causal side information [8] if S = ∅.\nProof: In the case without side information, the probabil- ity distribution (1) becomes\nThen, the mutual information in (2) becomes ∑\nV 1S ), X( V 1N )\n X( T ), Y ( U 0S ), Y ( U 0N )\nY ( V 0S ), Y ( V 0N ), X( T c )\nwhich is the same as the cut-set bound without causal side information.\nIn [8], we showed that the cut-set bound for the causal DMRN without causal side information covers the classical cut-set bound [4], thus our bound in Theorem 1 also covers the classical cut-set bound.\nIn this section, we apply the cut-set bound in Theorem 1 for a causal relay channel with causal side information and show the bound can be tight under some conditions. In a causal relay channel with causal side information, node 1 transmits its message to node 3 with help of causal relay node 2. Here, we assume that the channel state is not given for source node 1, i.e., the transmit signal of node 1 depends only on its message. Let X k denote the transmit signal of node k = 1, 2 and Y k denote the receive signal of node k = 2, 3. For this channel, N 1N = {1}, N 0S = {2}, and N 1S = {3}. Thus, an upper bound of a causal relay channel with causal side information is\n+ I(X 1 ; Y 3 |S, X 2 , Y 2 ), I(X 1 , X 2 , Y 2 ; Y 3 |S)\nwhich is reduced from Theorem 1. For the causal multiple- input multiple-output (MIMO) fading relay channel as shown in Fig. 2, the received signals at each node are\nwhere H jk is the fading channel matrix from nodes k to j, tr(Σ k ) ≤ P k for k = 1, 2, Σ k = E[X k X \u2020 k ], and Z k ∼ CN(0, I) for k = 2, 3. Also, let the number of transmit antennas of node k = 1, 2, be t k and the number of receive antennas of node j = 2, 3 be r j .\nThe following proposition shows that the capacity of the causal MIMO fading relay channel can be achieved by simple amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying under some conditions.\nProposition 2: If the relay transmit power satisﬁes E[tr[F(H 21 Σ ∗ 1 H \u2020 21 +I) F \u2020 ]] ≤ P 2 , then the capacity of the fading MIMO relay channel is\nwhere F = (U \u2020 31 H 32 ) −1 U \u2020 21 , Σ ∗ 1 is chosen among values satisfying\nat each transmission, U 21 , U 31 , Λ, and V are obtained by singular value decomposition (SVD) of channel matrices, i.e., [\nHere, [U T 21 U T 31 ] T , and V are unitary matrices, and Λ is a diagonal matrix with nonnegative entries.\nProof: Achievability. Assume that F is chosen as in the theorem and the power constraint is satisﬁed. Let node 1 transmit a codeword using a vector Gaussian codebook with a covariance matrix Σ ∗ 1 . We apply AF relaying using F, i.e., the relay\u2019s transmit signal X 2 is formed by X 2 = F Y 2 . Because X 2 satisﬁes the relay power constraint from the given conditions, it can be transmitted from the relay. Then, the receive signal at node 3 is\nUsing the knowledge of fading channel matrix at each transmission, the destination node 3 can calculate ˜ Y 3 deﬁned as follows:\nwhere (a) is because U \u2020 31 H 32 F = U \u2020 21 from the choice of F, and (b) is because [U T 21 U T 31 ] T is unitary matrix and ˜ Z 3 = U \u2020 21 Z 2 + U \u2020 31 Z 3 with E[˜Z 3 ˜ Z \u2020 3 ] = I.\n= E H 21 ,H 31 ,H 32 [h( ˜ Y 3 |H 21 , H 31 , H 32 ) − h(˜Z 3 )] = E H 21 ,H 31 ,H 32 [log |Λ V \u2020 Σ ∗ 1 V Λ + I |],\nConverse. Applying the cut-set bound to the causal MIMO fading relay channel with channel state information S = (H 21 , H 31 , H 32 ), the ﬁrst term in the bound can be written as follows:\n+ I(X 1 ; Y 3 | X 2 , Y 2 , H 21 , H 31 , H 32 ) = I(X 1 ; Y 2 , H 21 , H 31 , H 32 )\n= h(Y 2 , H 21 , H 31 , H 32 ) − h(Y 2 , H 21 , H 31 , H 32 | X 1 ) + h(Y 3 | X 2 , Y 2 , H 21 , H 31 , H 32 )\n= h(Y 2 , H 21 , H 31 , H 32 ) − h(Y 2 , H 21 , H 31 , H 32 | X 1 ) + h(Y \u2032 3 | X 2 , Y 2 , H 21 , H 31 , H 32 )\n≤ h(Y 2 , H 21 , H 31 , H 32 ) − h(Y 2 , H 21 , H 31 , H 32 | X 1 ) + h(Y \u2032 3 | Y 2 , H 21 , H 31 , H 32 )\n− h(Y 2 , H 21 , H 31 , H 32 | X 1 ) + h(Y \u2032 3 | Y 2 , H 21 , H 31 , H 32 )\n= I(X 1 ; H 21 , H 31 , H 32 ) + I(X 1 ; Y 2 , Y \u2032 3 | H 21 , H 31 , H 32 ) = I(X 1 ; Y 2 , Y \u2032 3 | H 21 , H 31 , H 32 )\n \n \n≤ E H 21 ,H 31 ,H 32 [log(πe) (r 2 +r 3 ) |K| − log(πe) (r 2 +r 3 ) ] = E H 21 ,H 31 ,H 32 [log |K|],\nwhere Y \u2032 3 = H 31 X 1 +Z 3 , (a) is because conditioning reduces entropy, (b) is because of the Markov chain X 2 −(X 1 , H 31 ) − Y \u2032 3 , and\nSince, the achievable rate and the upper bound coincide, the proof is completed.\nThen, we get the following result. Corollary 1: If\nin the causal fading relay channel, then its capacity is given by E[log{1 + (|h 21 | 2 + |h 31 | 2 )P 1 }].\nIn this paper, we studied a causal DMRN with causal side information consisting of relays with one sample delay and without delays. The main difference between the network considered in this paper and a strictly causal relay network is that there exist relays depending on the current received symbol as well as on the past received symbols in the proposed network. This paper investigated an outer bound for the causal DMRN with causal side information and showed that the bound covers the classical cut-set bound. Surprisingly, for a causal MIMO fading relay channel with channel state information, the obtained outer bound can be achievable based on a simple AF relaying scheme.\nThis research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the S&T Leading Primary Research funded by KAIST.
