The throughput measure is a useful metric that optimizes the system resources in the system perspective so that the total sum rate is to be maximized. This may result in non-uniform allocation among users, e.g., scheduling more power to the better channel users without considering fairness among users. Although there are many deﬁnitions of fairness, it generally means the consideration of each individual user so that the system resources are optimized from the perspective of that user. In this paper we investigate the penalty, in terms of the system throughput, to obtain (or maintain) fairness among users and see how the resulting penalty behaves, depending on the system parameters for multiple antenna broadcast channels.\nDue to the recent explosive use of smart phones, many efforts are being taken to increase the spectral efﬁciency, coop- eratively among base stations and non-cooperatively as well. Base station cooperation allows for the intelligent handling of inter-cell interference, the major predicament of contemporary mobile communication systems. As a practical example, the 3GPP Standardization Body is working on CoMP (coordinated multi-point transmission), which is a multi-cell processing technique to improve the cell-edge users\u2019 performance by controlling interference, for the LTE-Advanced system [1]. However, the price for base station cooperation involves the resolution of backhaul issues [2] (and references therein).\nIn a non-cooperative approach, Marzetta proposed a scheme of so called massive MIMO, which involves the installation of a large number of antennas at base stations to increase the spectral efﬁciency [3]. This is a promising technique but the problems of pilot contamination [4] and the physical installation of massive antennas remain unresolved. These technical challenges have become so widespread that inno- vative unconventional systems are now being actively studied. However, the analysis of such systems is too complicated to draw any fundamental conclusions. Additionally, since many existing systems are based on the SCP (single-cell processing) operation, it may be useful to investigate them in terms of SCP.\nUsing a simple SCP model, this paper investigates the price of fairness in terms of the system throughput loss and seeks fundamental insights into the system parameters of fairness and system throughput. In a MIMO broadcast channel, [5] studies an iterative approach to obtain the maximum sum rate and [6] analyzes the sum-rate offset by different transmit strategies including dirty paper coding and zero-forcing/block diagonalization. Reference [7] develops the max-min fair algo- rithm and investigates the fairness penalty but the analysis is limited to two-user case in [7]. The capacity region of MIMO broadcast channels is completely characterized in [8] but the details of each boundary point has yet to be understood in terms of throughput and fairness. To provide insights on the relationship of throughput and fairness, this paper analyzes the throughput penalty of boundary fair points for MIMO broadcast channels, in which the max-min fairness and the max-product fairness points on the boundary are considered.\nIn this paper, we calculate the sum-rate differences for the max-sum, the max-product, and the max-min optimal points on the capacity region boundary and analyze their asymptotic behaviors at high SNR. Speciﬁcally, we deﬁne the fairness penalty as the sum-rate difference between the achievable sum rate and the max-min fair rate, and derive it as the logarithmic ratio of the geometric mean and the harmonic mean of the beam vectors. By using the random matrix theory, we analyze the fairness penalty, both when the users have the same average SNR values and when the users have different SNR values as well. Interestingly, it is shown for the homogeneous case that the fairness penalty is negligible when the number of transmit antennas is large. This result suggests that optimizing the system for fairness does not penalize the total throughput under certain conditions.\nFig. 1: Characterization of the boundary of the capacity region in terms of the weight vector\nWe consider a K-user Gaussian MIMO broadcast channel in which the transmitter has M antennas and each receiver has a single antenna with M K . The received signal y k of user k is given by\ny k = h T k x + z k , \t k = 1, . . . , K, \t (1) where h k is the channel gain vector for user k, x is the transmit signal vector having a power constraint tr(E[xx H ])  P , and z k is complex Gaussian noise with unit variance. We assume that the transmitter has perfect knowledge of all channel vectors and each receiver has perfect knowledge of its own channel vector. For the sake of notation, we let H be the concatenated channel vector, i.e., H = [h 1 h 2 · · · h K ] .\nIt is well known that dirty paper coding (DPC) achieves the capacity region of MIMO broadcast channel [8]. The boundary of the capacity region can be characterized by the weighted sum-rate maximization [7]:\nf (µ) , max µ · R subject to R 2 C(H, P), (2) where µ = [µ 1 µ 2 · · · µ K ] is the weight vector, R = [R 1 R 2 · · · R K ] T is the rate vector, and C(H, P ) is the capacity region of the broadcast channel. Optimization (2) ﬁnds the point on the boundary of the capacity region where the tangent to the capacity region is deﬁned by the weight vector. Figure 1 illustrates the characterization of the capacity region boundary in terms of the weight vector for a two-user case. By solving all possible µ 1 and µ 2 satisfying µ 1 +µ 2 = 1 , the entire boundary of the capacity region can be traced out [9].\nBecause of unwieldy complexity, this paper considers a sim- pler scheme with the zero-forcing beamforming [10], which will provide a more straightforward analysis and, moreover, can result in a practical implementation. The performance gap due to the zero-forcing beamforming instead of DPC will be presented in [11]. We denote the achievable region by zero- forcing beamforming C ZF (H, P ) , whose boundary is similarly traced out by solving the weighted sum-rate optimization.\nTo calculate the achievable rate by zero-forcing beamform- ing, we deﬁne g k as the orthogonal projection of h k onto the null space spanned by {h l } l 6=k [10]:\n✓ k = \\h k , Span(h 1 , · · · , h k 1 , h k+1 , · · · , h K ). (4) Notice that the underlying assumption on the use of zero- forcing is that the number of transmitter antennas is at least equal to the aggregate number of receive antennas, i.e., M\nK throughout the paper. This is done to avoid dimensionality issues. When the number of independent beam is less than the number of users, zero-forcing is not feasible. Assuming feasible, the sum capacity by zero-forcing is given by [6]\nand can be approximated with uniform power allocation, where the approximation error is negligible at high SNR, and thus\nwhere ⇠ = refers to equivalence in the limit (i.e., the difference between both sides converges to zero as P ! 1), and G denotes the geometric mean operator (i.e., G(x\nIf we schedule with the intent to achieve throughput maxi- mization, the users with poor channel quality will be sacriﬁced, resulting in an unfair allocation. This section deals with such unfairness issues among users by considering the allocation of resources with fairness criteria such as max-min and max- product scheduling.\nOne of the simplest fairness strategies is to maximize the minimum of all user rates [7]:\nmin(R 1 , . . . , R K ). \t (7) Here, we denote the resulting rate as C sym since the optimal point is determined at the supremum of symmetric rates, i.e., the boundary point on the capacity region intersecting with the line deﬁned by R 1 = R 2 = · · · = R K . Notice that this max- min fair rate C sym is the maximization of the worst-user\u2019s rate with all the users operating at the same rate, thereby ensuring a maximum fair rate.\nUnlike the sum-rate maximization optimization, the weight vector corresponding to C sym depends on the channel real- ization and the power. With the function in (2), the max-min achievable rate can be also found by [7]:\nf (µ) \t (8) where f(µ) is convex (see [11] for the derivation).\nWith the zero-forcing beamforming, the maximum achiev- able max-min rate is summarized by the following theorem:\nTheorem 1: The symmetric achievable rate with zero- forcing can be obtained:\n0 B B B B\n1 C C C C A\nwhere H and g k are related according to (3), and H denotes the harmonic mean, i.e., H(x 1 , . . . , x K ) = K/( 1 x 1 + · · ·+ 1 x K ) . Proof: See [11].\nThis subsection considers another fair scheduling strategy that ﬁnds the achievable product rate:\nR prod k (H, P ). \t (11) The product maximization of individual user performance is similarly studied in [12], in which the optimization is connected to the Nash arbitration scheme. Notice that the optimization in (10) is equivalent to\nlog R k , \t (12) which solves for the proportional fair scheduling [13][14]. Speciﬁcally, following the general idea in [13], a proportional- fair scheduler for the MIMO broadcast channel was formulated in [15] assuming that the DPC technique is exploited at the transmitter.\nAlthough we cannot obtain the close-form solution to (10), we can ﬁnd the optimal point iteratively with the weighted sum-rate maximization [9]. The same argument holds for zero-forcing beamforming, in which rate vectors and the sum rate are denoted by R prod ZF and C prod ZF , respectively. Since the optimization is convex, we can use the ﬁxed point iteration in Algorithm 1.\nFigure 2 illustrates the achievable zero-forcing sum rates for different optimizations when M = 5 and K = 5. As can be seen, the max sum-rate optimization achieves the highest sum throughput while the max-min fairness optimization achieves the lowest sum throughput. Moreover, the rate gap between the twos seems to remain constant especially when P is large. This will be referred to as the fairness penalty and further analyzed in the next section. There is one interesting fact about the behavior of the product maximization which is illustrated in the dotted curve marked with triangles in the ﬁgure. As P increases, the achievable sum rate of the product maximization converges to that of the sum-rate maximization. We also prove this theoretically with:\nAlgorithm 1 Max-product fair scheduler with the weighted sum-rate maximization algorithm\n˜ R i , \t k = 1, . . . , K \t (14) 3. Update the weight\nFig. 2: Achievable sum rates with different optimization cri- teria\nTheorem 2: The achievable rate by zero forcing with the product maximization converges to that with the sum-rate maximization at high SNR, i.e.,\n= 0. \t (16) Proof: See [11].\nThe theorem implies that the throughput loss due to the max- product fairness criterion is minuscule in the regime of high SNR.\nThis section investigates the sum-rate loss to maintain the max-min fairness in high SNR environment. Since the penalty is negligible for the max-product fair criterion according to Theorem 2, this analysis is focused on max-min fairness. After deﬁning the fairness penalty as the throughput loss from the max-sum rate to the max-min rate, we calculate the penalty for instantaneous channel realizations. Under the Rayleigh- fading channel assumption, we investigate the fairness for homogenous average SNR users and then for heterogeneous SNR users.\nThis represents the rate penalty per user between the maximum throughput scheduling C sum ZF (H, P ) and the maximum fair scheduling C sym ZF (H, P ) .\nFrom (6) and (9), we can immediately obtain the fairness penalty as:\nH(kg 1 k 2 , · · · , kg K k 2 ) , \t (18) where G and H denote the geometric mean and the harmonic mean, respectively.\nWith this instantaneous penalty value, we investigate the fairness penalty when fading is applied.\nWe now consider the homogenous SNR case, i.e., all the users have the same average SNR. Moreover, we assume the standard i.i.d. Rayleigh fading distribution, where the entries of h k are i.i.d. complex Gaussian with unit variance.\nWith the help of random matrix theory [16], we can derive the ergodic behavior of the fairness penalty as:\nTheorem 4: The expected fairness penalty due to the max- imum fair scheduling in Rayleigh fading is given by\nE[ ZF (H)] = 1 ln 2  (M K + 1) log 2 K + E\nwhere  (·) is the Euler\u2019s digamma function and E denotes the expectation operator. Proof: See [11].\nMoreover, the fairness penalty becomes negligible when the number of transmit antennas is large:\nTheorem 5: The expected fairness penalty diminishes as M grows, i.e.,\nThis implies that pursuing fairness does not sacriﬁce the sum- rate performance where the number of transmit antennas is large. It should be noted that the optimal power allocation strategies for the max-sum criterion and the max-min crite- rion are not necessarily the same but the resulting rate gap diminishes for large transmit antennas. Notice also that this result only applies for the homogeneous average SNR users. When the users have different average SNR values, the fairness penalty is not negligible no matter how many antennas are installed at the transmitter (as will be discussed in the next subsection).\nFor another extreme situation, we consider the case of a large number of users by assuming that there are a sufﬁciently large number of transmit antennas so that dimensionality is not a factor. In this case, we may substitute the geometric\nmean and the harmonic mean of {kg k k 2 } K k=1 in (18) with those of a continuous random variable, e.g., G[X] and H[X], respectively, where X is a random variable having the same distribution with kg k k 2 . More generally, we assume that every kg k k 2 has 2 -distribution with 2L degrees of freedom. Then the fairness penalty becomes:\nTheorem 6: If kg k k 2 has 2 -distribution with 2L degrees of freedom and there are innumerable users, then\nThus far we have assumed that the average strength of channel gains is the same for all users. However, it is more likely that users will have different SNR values due to variations in the wireless environment; e.g., near-far and interference effects. In this circumstance, pursuing fairness would be expected to be quite different from the throughput optimization. We consider this unequal average SNR effect on the fairness penalty in this subsection.\nWe assume that the channel gain of each user can be decomposed into\nh k = p k ˜ h k , k = 1, . . . , K, \t (22) where k denotes the average SNR of user k. The elements of ˜ h k are complex Gaussian with zero mean and unit variance.\nUnlike the homogeneous SNR case, it is difﬁcult to obtain a closed-form analytical expression for the heterogeneous SNR case due to various users\u2019 distribution scenarios. Consequently, the average SNR distribution does not lend itself to quantiﬁ- cation. Instead, we investigate the fairness penalty analysis numerically. Since we deﬁne the fairness penalty at high SNR, i.e., P ! 1 in (17), we call the penalty at ﬁnite SNR the sum rate difference in this subsection.\nFigure 3 shows the sum rate differences for three sets of different average SNRs. The top three solid curves illustrate the sum rate differences when the average SNR for the ﬁrst user is 0.01, that of the second user is 1, and that of the third user is 100. Among the top three solid curves, the lowest curve (circles) is for M = 3, K = 3, the middle curve (triangles) is for M = 10, K = 3, and the upper curve (squares) is for M = 100, K = 3. By the same token, the second three dotted curves illustrate the sum rate differences for 1 = 0.1, 2 = 1, 3 = 10 . The lowest three dashed curve illustrate the difference for 1 = 2 = 3 = 1 , similarly. As can be seen, there is a constant bias in the sum rate difference when the average SNR \u2019s are different. Furthermore, the sum rate difference is large when the variance in the average SNRs is large. Additionally, we can see that the sum rate differences converge as P increases and the convergence rate increases as M grows.\n1) Two-user case (K = 2): Due to the complication of the users\u2019 distribution, the fairness penalty analysis needs to rely on the numerical results for the heterogeneous average SNR\nP (dB) (1/K)C\n, (b) 1 = 0.1, 2 = 1, 3 = 10 , and (c) 1 = 2 = 3 = 1 .\nusers. As a special case of K = 2, however, we can perform an analytical analysis.\nWithout loss of generality, we assume that the average SNRs of each user are:\n(23b) for ↵ > 1. With algebraic manipulations, we can derive the fairness penalty as\nwhere ZF ( ˜ H) is the fairness penalty for the homogeneous channels ˜h 1 and ˜h 2 whose elements are Gaussian with zero mean and unit variance.\nNotice that the second additive term in (24), i.e., log 2 ((1 + ↵)/2 p ↵) , serves as a constant bias. Since this bias term is solely determined by the heterogeneity of the different SNR values, this bias is inevitable. Notice also that this term is increasing with respect to ↵ for ↵ > 1, which implies that the fairness penalty grows as the SNR unbalance increases. Since the two additive terms are always non-negative and the second term is monotonically increasing, the fairness penalty can be considerable despite the application of massive antennas at the transmitter. This trend is captured in Table I, which shows the ergodic fairness penalty for heterogeneous two-user Rayleigh fading channels.\nWe have investigated the throughput penalty for the max- product and max-min fair scheduling algorithms. At high SNR, we showed that the penalty is negligible for the max-product fair scheduler. We also showed that the penalty of the max-min fair scheduler decreases as the number of transmit antennas increases when all the users have the same average SNR value.\nTABLE I: Fairness penalty for heterogeneous two-user (K = 2 ) Rayleigh fading channels\nThis implies that these fairness scheduling algorithms do not penalize the total system throughput much while maintaining fairness among users so that the quality of user experience can be enhanced. When the average SNRs are different among users, however, there is a constant bias term in the fairness penalty, which cannot be compensated for by increasing the number of transmit antennas. The goal of the analysis provided herein is to provide insight into the tradeoff of throughput against fairness, thereby allowing for the determination of the applicability of fair schedulers to enhance the quality of the user experience."},"refs":[{"authors":[],"title":{"text":"GPP TR 36"}},{"authors":[{"name":"D.
