The interested reader can ﬁnd an excellent historical review in [4].\nIn the past 20 years much research has centered on codes on graphs, in particular turbo codes and low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. These codes are imminently practical since they can be designed to have very good performance when decoded via low complexity message-passing algorithms. A central research topic for these codes is the interaction of the graphical structure of a code and its performance. Turbo codes themselves are a prime example how the \u201cright\u201d structure is important to achieve good performance [5]. Further important parameters and structures are, the degree distribution (dd) and in particular the fraction of degree-two variable nodes, multi- edge ensembles [6], degree-two nodes in a chain [7], and protographs [8], [9].\nOur main aim is to explain the role of a further structural element in the realm of sparse graph codes, namely that of\n\u201cspatial coupling.\u201d We will show that this coupling of graphs leads to a remarkable change in their performance. Ensembles designed in this way combine some of the nice elements of polar codes (namely the fact that they are provably capacity achieving under low complexity decoding) with the practical advantages of sparse graph codes (the codes are competitive already for moderate lengths). Perhaps most importantly, it is possible to construct universal such codes for the whole class of BMS channels. Here, universality refers to the fact that one and the same ensemble is good for a whole class of channels, assuming that at the receiver we have knowledge of the channel.\nThe potential of spatially coupled codes has long been rec- ognized. Our contribution lies therefore not in the introduction of a new coding scheme, but in clarifying the mechanism that make these codes perform so well.\nThe term spatially coupled codes was coined in [10]. Convolutional LDPC codes (more precisely, terminated con- volutional LDPC codes), which were introduced by Felstr¨om and Zigangirov in [11], and their many variants belong to this class. There is a considerable literature on convolutional-like LDPC ensembles. Due to space constraints, we have to refer the reader to the full version of this paper [12] for a thorough review of the historical development.\nIt was recently shown in [10] that for transmission over the BEC spatially coupled ensembles have a BP threshold which is essentially equal to the MAP threshold of the underlying uncoupled ensemble. Further, this threshold is also essentially equal to the MAP threshold of the coupled ensemble. This phenomena was called threshold saturation in [10] since the BP threshold takes on its largest possible value (the MAP threshold). This signiﬁcant improvement in the performance is due to the spatial coupling of the underlying code. Those \u201csections\u201d of the code that have already succeeded in decoding can help their neighboring less fortunate sections in the decoding process. In this manner, the information propagates from the \u201cboundaries\u201d, where the bits are known perfectly towards the \u201cmiddle\u201d. In a recent paper [13], Lentmaier and Fettweis independently formulated the same statement as a conjecture and provided numerical evidence for its validity.\nBelief propagation (BP) thresholds for transmission over general BMS channels were computed by means of a nu- merical procedure by Lentmaier, Sridharan, Zigangirov and Costello in [14]. Further, in [15] (conjectured) MAP thresholds for some LDPC ensembles were computed according to the Maxwell construction. Comparing these two values, one can check empirically that also for transmission over general BMS channels the BP threshold of the coupled ensembles is essentially equal to the (conjectured) MAP threshold of the underlying ensemble. Indeed, recently both [16] as well as [17] provided further numerical evidence that the threshold saturation phenomenon also applies to general BMS channels.\nWe prove that this indeed the case. More precisely, we show that for general BMS channels, spatially coupled en- sembles achieve the so-called area threshold of the underlying ensemble. As a consequence, given a desired error probability and a gap to capacity, we can construct a spatially coupled ensemble which fulﬁlls these constraints universally on this class of channels under belief propagation decoding. In fact, most codes in that ensemble have that property. The quantiﬁer universal refers to the single ensemble/code which is good for all channels if we assume that the channel is known at the receiver.\nAlthough this paper is only concerned with coding, let us remark that there is to date a fairly extensive literature on the analysis of spatially coupled codes, and more generally, the principle of spatial coupling applied to problems in communi- cations, computer science, compressive sensing, and statistical physics. For a detailed discussion please see [12].\nThroughout the paper we consider transmission over binary- input memoryless output-symmetric (BMS) channels. More precisely we will assume that the channel belongs to an ordered, complete and smooth family (for deﬁnition see [18]). Also, we limit our investigation to the analysis of the BP decoder. We are interested in the asymptotic performance of the BP decoder, i.e., the performance when the blocklength n tends to inﬁnity. This asymptotic performance is characterized by the so-called density evolution (DE) equation [19].\nIn the sequel we use H(.) and B(.) to denote the entropy and Battacharyya parameters respectively. Also, the symmetric densities appearing are denoted in the L-domain [18]. Fixed- points (FPs) of DE play a crucial role in the asymptotic anal- ysis of the BP decoder. E.g., the BP threshold is characterized by the existence/non-existence of a non-trivial FP of forward DE (iterating DE equations starting with the density ∆ 0 ) for a particular channel. An even more powerful picture arises if instead of looking at a single FP at a time we visualize a whole collection of FPs. In order to visualize many FPs at the same time it is convenient to project them. For BEC the projection of choice is the EXIT functional (see [18]).\nA good choice for the projection operator for general channels is the GEXIT functional [15]. For the BEC this coincides with the EXIT functional (see [18]). For the general\nwhere we think of y as ﬁxed with respect to σ. In words, G(c σ , ·) measures the ratio of the change in entropy of c σ\ny d l (the entropy of the decision of any variable node under BP decoding) versus the change of entropy of the channel c σ as a function of σ.\nWe get the GEXIT curve by plotting (H(c σ ), G(c σ , y d l )) for a family of FPs {c σ , x σ }. This is shown in Figure 1 for the (3, 6)-regular ensemble assuming that transmission takes place over the BAWGNC. To plot Figure 1 we have used the procedure in [15], referred there as reverse DE, to get a complete family of FPs for all entropies from 0 to 1. For a detailed discussion we refer the reader to [15], [18].\nFor the BEC it is easy to see that the area enclosed by the GEXIT curve is equal to the design rate [18]. We will show that a similar statement holds also for the case of more general channels. This property is one of the main ingredients in our proof.\nFor the BEC it is trivial to see that the BP GEXIT curve indeed exists. But for general BMS channels this is not immediate. We ﬁrst recall a lemma from [15] which shows that indeed for a subset of parameters, the BP GEXIT curve indeed exists and is smooth. For the proofs of the ensuing lemmas we refer the reader to [12].\nThen, for any h ∈ [0, 1], there exists at most one density x h so that (c h , x h ) forms a FP which fulﬁlls\nFurthermore, if such a density x h exists, then it coincides with the forward DE FP. Finally, B(x h ) is Lipschitz continuous with respect to B(c h ). More precisely, if two FPs (c h 1 , x h 1 )\nand (c h 2 , x h 2 ) satisfy the condition B(c h i )(d l − 1)(d r − 1)(1 − B (x h i ) 2 ) d r −2 ≤ 1 − δ for some δ > 0, then\nThe following lemma states that, at least for sufﬁciently large entropies, the BP GEXIT curve indeed exists and is well behaved.\nLemma 2 (Continuity For Large Entropies): Assume that communication takes place over an ordered and complete family {c h } h , where h = H(c h ), using the dd pair (d l , d r ). Consider the set of FP pairs {(c h , x h )} obtained by applying forward DE to each channel c h . Let\nb(x) = (d l − 1) 2 (d r − 1) 2 x(1 − x) 2(d r −2) , c(x) = x/a(x).\nLet ˜ x be the unique solution in (0, 1] of the equation a(x) − b(x) = 0. Then the family {(c h , x h )} 1 h=˜ h(d\n, with ˜ h(d l , d r , {c h }) = h BMS (c(˜ x)), satisﬁes (1), is Lipschitz continuous wrt to the Battacharyya parameter of the channel, where h BMS (·) is the function which maps the Battacharyya constant of an element of the family to the corresponding entropy. Further, B(x h ) > 0 for all h ≥ ˜ h(d l , d r , {c h }).\nThe following lemma gives a universal and analytical lower bound on the entropy.\nAssume that communication takes place over an ordered and complete family {c h } h , where h = H(c h ), using the dd pair (d l , d r ) with d r ≥ 4 and d l ≥ 3. Let a(x) be deﬁned as in Lemma 2. Consider the set of FP pairs {(c h , x h )} which is derived by applying forward DE to each channel c h . Then the GEXIT curve associated to {(c h , x h )} h>h , where\nis Lipschitz continuous wrt the Battacharyya parameter of the channel. Also, ˜ h(d l , d r , {c h }) ≤ h, where ˜ h(d l , d r , {c h }) is the quantity introduced in Lemma 2, and h ≤ e 1 4\n, so that h tends to zero when d r tends to inﬁnity.\nFor some numerical values of ˜ h(d l , d r , {c h }) and h we refer the reader to Tables I and II in [18].\nIn the previous we derived conditions which guarantee that the BP GEXIT curve indeed exists and is continuous in a given region. We will now discuss the GEXIT integral, the area under the GEXIT curve. In order to derive some properties of this integral, we will ﬁrst introduce GEXIT integrals in a slightly more general form before we apply them to ensembles.\nDeﬁnition 4 (Basic GEXIT Integral): Given two families {c σ } σ σ and {z σ } σ σ , the GEXIT integral {c σ , z σ } σ σ is deﬁned as\nDeﬁnition 5 (GEXIT Integral of Ensemble): Consider the (d l , d r )-regular ensemble and assume that {c σ , x σ } σ σ is a family of FPs of DE. Deﬁne y σ = x d r −1 σ \t . Then\nH dc σ dσ\nLemma 6 (Evaluation of GEXIT Integral): Assume that communication takes place over an ordered, complete and piece-wise smooth family {c h } h , using the degree-distribution pair (d l , d r ). Let {c h , x h } h be the FP family of forward DE. Set x = x h ∗ , h ∗ ≥ ˜ h(d l , d r , {c h }), where ˜ h(d l , d r , {c h }) is the quantity introduced in Lemma 2. Then,\n)H(x d r ) − (d l − 1)H(x d r −1 ). Discussion: Note that this GEXIT integral has a simple graphical interpretation; it is the area under the GEXIT curve. The condition h ∗ ≥ ˜ h(d l , d r , {c h }) ensures that this curve is well deﬁned and integrable.\nDeﬁnition 7 (Area Threshold \u2013 [15]): Consider \t the (d l , d r )-regular ensemble and transmission over a complete and ordered channel family {c h } 1 h=0 . For each h ∈ [0, 1], let x h be the forward DE FP associated to channel c h . The area threshold , denote it by h A (d l , d r , {c h }), is deﬁned as\nwhere A(x h , d l , d r ) is equal to A, which is given in Lemma 6, evaluated at the FP x h , when transmitting with the (d l , d r )- regular ensemble.\nNote that A(∆ +∞ , d l , d r ) = 0 and that x h = ∆ +∞ for all h < h BP (d l , d r , {c h }). Therefore the set over which we take the supremum is non-empty and h BP (d l , d r , {c h }) ≤ h A (d l , d r , {c h }).\nRecall that the GEXIT integral has a simple graphical interpretation \u2013 it is the area under the GEXIT curve, assuming of course that both the curve and the integral exist. The area threshold is therefore that channel parameter h A (d l , d r , {c h }) such that the GEXIT integral from h A (d l , d r , {c h }) to 1 is equal to 1 − d l d\nConsider a sequence of (d l , d r )-regular ensembles of ﬁxed design rate r = 1 − d l /d r and with d l , d r tending to inﬁnity.\n− d l e −4(d r −1)( 2(1−r) 11e ) 4 3 , where ˜ h(d l , d r , {c h }) is deﬁned in Lemma 2. Then for any BMS channel family {c h }\nFurthermore, A(x h A , d l , d r ) = 0 and, for ﬁxed rate and increasing degrees, the sequence of the area thresh- olds h A (d l , d r , {c h }) converges to the Shannon threshold\n= 1 − r universally over the whole class of BMS channel families.\nOur goal is to show that coupled ensembles can achieve capacity on general BMS channels. Let us recall the deﬁnition of an ensemble which is particularly suited for the purpose of analysis. We call it the (d l , d r , L, w) ensemble, sse [12] for variants. The variable nodes of the ensemble are at positions [−L, L], L ∈ N. At each position there are M variable nodes, M ∈ N. Conceptually we think of the check nodes to be located at all integer positions from [−∞, ∞]. Only some of these positions actually interact with the variable nodes. At each position there are d l d\nM check nodes. It remains to describe how the connections are chosen. We assume that each of the d l connections of a variable node at position i is uniformly and independently chosen from the range [i, . . . , i + w − 1], where w is a \u201csmoothing\u201d parameter. In the same way, we assume that each of the d r connections of a check node at position i is independently chosen from the range [i − w + 1, . . . , i]. A detailed construction of this ensemble can be found in [10]. For the paper we will always be interested in the limit when M tends to inﬁnity while L as well as d l and d r stay ﬁxed. In this limit we can analyze the system via DE, simplifying our task. Not surprisingly, spatially coupled ensembles inherit many of their properties from the underlying ensemble. Perhaps most importantly, the local connectivity is the same. Further, the design rates are also close, see [10].\nDeﬁnition 9 (Admissible Parameters): Fix the design rate r of the uncoupled system. We say that the parameters (d l , d r ) and w are admissible if the following conditions are fulﬁlled with r = 1 − d l d\n, where ˜ h(d l , d r , {c h }) is the bound stated in Lemma 2,\n) 2 , (vi) w > 2(d l − 1)(d r − 1)d 2 r (4(\nWe say that the ensemble (d l , d r , L, w) is admissible if the parameters (d l , d r ) and w are admissible. If we are only concerned about the conditions on (d l , d r ), then we will say that (d l , d r ) is admissible.\nDiscussion: Conditions (i), (ii) and (iii) are fulﬁlled if we take the degrees sufﬁciently large. Conditions (iv), (v), and (vi) can all be fulﬁlled by picking a sufﬁciently large connection width w. Numerical experiments indicated that for any 3 ≤ d l ≤ d r and w ≥ 2 the threshold saturation phenomenon happens, with a \u201cwiggle-size\u201d which vanishes exponentially in w.\nTheorem 10 (BP Threshold of the (d l , d r , L, w) Ensemble): Consider transmission over a complete, smooth, and ordered family of BMS channels, denote it by {c h }, using the admissible ensemble (d l , d r , L, w). Let h BP (d l , d r , L, w, {c h }) and h MAP (d l , d r , L, w, {c h }) denote the corresponding BP and MAP threshold. Further, let R(d l , d r , L, w) denote the design rate of this ensemble and set r = 1 − d l /d r . Finally, let h A (d l , d r , {c h }) denote the area threshold of the underlying (d l , d r )-regular ensemble and the given channel family. Then\n≤ h BP (d l , d r , L, w, {c h }) \t (3) ≤ h MAP (d l , d r , L, w, {c h })\n1) 2(d l −1)(d r −1) w \t . Note that f (d l , d r , w) depends only on the dd (d l , d r ) and w but is universal wrt the channel family {c h }. Furthermore, lim w→∞ lim L→∞ R(d l , d r , L, w) = 1 − d l d\n. Discussion :\n(i) The bound h BP ≤ h MAP is trivial and only listed for completeness. The upper bound on the MAP threshold of the coupled ensemble is obtained by using the circular ensemble deﬁned in [12]. We ﬁrst provide a lower bound on the conditional entropy for the circular ensemble when transmitting over a BMS channel with entropy h. This is obtained by observing that the BP GEXIT curve for the circular ensemble and the underlying uncoupled ensemble are the same. We then show that setting w − 1 sections to 0 does not signiﬁcantly decrease this entropy. Overall this gives an upper bound on the MAP threshold of the coupled ensemble in terms of the area threshold of the underlying ensemble. For details see [12].\n(ii) The lower bound on h BP (d l , d r , L, w, {c h }) expressed in (3) is the main result of this paper. It shows that, up to a term which tends to zero when w tends to inﬁnity, the BP threshold of the coupled ensemble is at least as large as the area threshold of the underlying ensemble.\nEmpirical evidence suggests that the convergence speed wrt w is exponential. Our bound only guarantees a convergence speed of order 1/w.\nIn Theorem 10 we start with a smooth, complete and ordered channel family. But it is straightforward to convert this theorem and to apply it directly to single channels or to a collection of channels. The next statement makes this precise.\nCorollary 11 ( (d l , d r , L, w) Universally Achieves Capacity): The (d l , d r , L, w) ensemble is universally capacity achieving for the class of BMS channels. More precisely, assume we are given > 0 and a target rate R. Let C(R) denote the set\nof BMS channels of capacity at least R. To each c ∈ C(R) associate the family {c h } 1 h=0 , by deﬁning\nR(d l , d r , L, w) ≥ R − 4 , inf\nSince for each c ∈ C(R) the associated family {c h } 1 h=0 is ordered by degradation, this implies that we can transmit with this ensemble reliably over each of the channels in C(R) with rate at least R − 4 , i.e., arbitrarily close to the Shannon limit.\nAssume we are given > 0 and a target rate R. Let C(R) denote the set of BMS channels of capacity at least R. Then there exists a set of parameters (d l , d r , L, w) of rate at least R − 5 with the following property. Let C(n) be an element of (d l , d r , L, w) with blocklength n, where we assume that n only goes over the subsequence of admissible values. Then\nIn words, almost all codes in (d l , d r , L, w) of sufﬁcient length are good for all channels in C(R).\nWe have shown that one can construct low-complexity cod- ing schemes which are universal for the whole class of BMS channels by spatially coupling regular LDPC ensembles. Thus, we resolve a long-standing open problem of whether there exist low-density parity-check ensembles which are capacity- achieving using BP decoding. These ensembles are not only attractive in an asymptotic setting but also for applications and standards since they can easily be designed to have both, good thresholds and low error ﬂoors. In addition, these ensembles are universal in the sense that one and the same ensemble is good for the whole class of BMS channels, assuming that the channel is known at the receiver. In fact, we have shown the stronger statement that almost all codes in such an ensemble are good for all channels in this class. Let us discuss some open questions. If one can establish that the MAP threshold of the uncoupled ensemble is at least as large as the MAP threshold of the coupled ensemble, then using the main theorem above the Maxwell conjecture [18] would be proved. Another important challenge would be to show that the convergence speed to the Shannon limit is much faster than we can actually prove, as is observed in practice. From a practical point of view, a ﬁrm understanding is needed of how the performance of such codes scale in each of the parameters in d l , d r , L, M , w. This would permit to design codes in a principled fashion. Further important topics are, the design of good termination schemes to mitigate the rate-loss, a systematic investigation of how structure in the interconnection pattern as well as the codes inﬂuences the performance, and\nscheduling (e.g., windowed decoding) to control the decoder complexity [16]. The threshold saturation phenomenon has been empirically found to hold in a large variety of systems. This suggests that one should be able to formulate a rather general theory rather than ﬁnding a separate proof for each of these cases. For all one-dimensional systems this has recently been accomplished in [12]. For higher-dimensional or inﬁnite- dimensional systems this is a challenging open problem.\nThe work of R.
