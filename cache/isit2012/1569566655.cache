It has been shown that multiple-antenna arrays have the ability to reach higher transmission rates [1], [2]. With no delay constraint, the ergodic nature of the fading channel can be experienced by sending very large transmission blocks, and the ergodic capacity is well studied [3]. When the channel variation is slow, the channel can be estimated relatively accurately at the receiver. By assuming perfect CSI at the receiver but no CSI at the transmitter, Telatar [2] showed that the ergodic capacity of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels is achieved by sending an uncorrelated cir- cularly symmetric zero mean equal power complex Gaussian codebook on all transmit antennas.\nDue to the stringent delay constraint for the problem in consideration, the transmission block length is forced to be shorter than the dynamics of the slow fading process, though still large enough to yield a reliable communication. The performance of such channels are usually evaluated by outage capacity. Jorswieck and Boch [4] proved that in uncorrelated MISO channels, the optimum transmit strategy minimizing the outage probability is to use a fraction of all available transmit antennas and perform equal power allocation with uncorrelated signals.\nThe maximum throughput is an important performance measure in block fading channels, which is deﬁned as the maximum of the product of the transmission rate and the probability of successful transmission using a single-layer\ncode. As mentioned in [4], their results on the outage prob- ability cannot be directly applied to this metric due to the maximization. In this paper, we prove that to achieve the maximum throughput in an uncorrelated MISO channel, the optimum transmit strategy is to send equal power uncorrelated signals from all available antennas.\nThe maximum average achievable rate is another perfor- mance measure which is important in some applications. A good example for such applications is a TV broadcasting system where users with better channels can receive additional services such as high deﬁnition TV signals [5]. Due to the large number of users, the transmitter cannot access the CSI. In order to increase the average achievable rate, Shamai and Steiner [6] proposed a broadcast approach (multi-layer coding) for a point-to-point block fading channel with no CSI at the transmitter. Since the average achievable rate increases with the number of code layers, they reached the highest average achievable rate using a continuous-layer (inﬁnite-layer) code. This idea was applied to a two-hop single-relay channel in [7], a two-hop parallel-relay network (the diamond channel) in [8], and a channel with two collocated cooperative users in [9]. The optimized trade-off between the QoS and network coverage in a multicast network was derived in [5] using the broadcast approach. Here, we derive the maximum expected-rate of MISO channels, which is deﬁned as the maximum average decodable rate when a multi-layer code is transmitted. We prove that to maximize the expected-rate in MISO channels, it is optimum to transmit equal power independent signals on all available antennas in each layer. Using the continuous- layer coding approach, the maximum expected-rate of MISO channels is then obtained and formulated in closed form.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the preliminaries are presented. Then, the maximum through- put and the maximum expected-rate of MISO channels are obtained in Sections III and IV, respectively.\nThroughout the paper, we represent the probability of event A by Pr {A}, and the expected operation by E(·). The notation \u201c ln\u201d is used for natural logarithm, and rates are expressed in nats . We denote f x ( ·) and F x ( ·) as the probability density function (PDF) and the cumulative density function (CDF) of random variable x, respectively. For any function F (x), let us deﬁne F (x) △ = 1 − F (x) and F \u2032 (x) △ = dF (x) dx . X is\na vector, Q is a matrix, and tr (Q) denotes the trace of Q. s o is the optimum solution with respect to the variable s. We denote the matrix transpose, matrix conjugate transpose, and absolute value operators by · T , · \u2020 , and | · |, respectively. Let h ℓ denote the ℓ\u2019th component of vector h. I n t and CN (0, 1) denote the n t × n t identity matrix and the complex circularly symmetric Gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit variance, respectively. W 0 ( ·) is the zero branch of the Lambert W -function, also called the omega function, which is the inverse function of f (W ) = W e W . E 1 (x) is the exponential integral function, which is ∞ x e −t t dt, x ≥ 0. Γ(n, x) △ = ∞ x t n −1 e −t dt is the upper incomplete gamma function, and Γ(n) △ = Γ(n, 0).\nA MISO channel with n t transmit antennas is deﬁned as a channel with the input-output relationship Y = hX +Z, where Y is the received signal, h T ∼ [CN (0, 1)] n\n×1 is the channel vector, Z ∼ CN (0, 1) is the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), and X is the transmitted signal under the total power constraint E X \u2020 X = E tr XX \u2020 = tr E XX \u2020 ≤ P . Deﬁn-\ning Q as the transmit covariance matrix, i.e., Q = E XX \u2020 , the instantaneous mutual information is I = ln 1 + hQh \u2020 .\nIn the following, the performance metrics which are widely used throughout the paper are deﬁned.\nDeﬁnition 1 The throughput R s is the average achievable rate when a single-layer code with a ﬁxed rate R is trans- mitted, i.e., the transmission rate times the probability of suc- cessful transmission. The maximum throughput, namely R m s , is the maximum of the throughput over all transmit covariance matrices Q, and transmission rates R. Mathematically,\nDeﬁnition 2 The expected-rate R f is the statistical expec- tation of the achievable rate when a multi-layer code is transmitted. The maximum expected-rate, namely R m f , is the maximum of the expected-rate over all transmit covariance matrices and transmission rates in each layer, and all power distributions of the layers. Mathematically,\nwhere R i , Q i , and I i are the transmission rate, transmit covariance matrix, and instantaneous mutual information in the i\u2019th layer, respectively.\nIf a continuum of code layers are transmitted, the maximum continuous-layer (inﬁnite-layer) expected-rate, namely R m c , is given by maximizing the continuous-layer expected-rate over the layers\u2019 power distribution.\nDeﬁnition 3 The ergodic capacity C erg is the maximum ex- pected value of the instantaneous mutual information I over all transmit covariance matrices Q. Mathematically,\nThe following propositions whose proofs are offered in [10] establish that the maximum throughput and maximum expected-rate are upper-bounded by Eq. (4).\nProposition 1 In fading channels, the maximum throughput and maximum expected-rate are less than or equal to the ergodic capacity.\nProposition 2 The ergodic capacity in an n t × 1 MISO Rayleigh fading channel with total power constraint P is\nwhere E 1 ( ·) is the exponential integral function. The ergodic capacity in a 1 × n r single-input multiple-output (SIMO) channel with total power constraint P equals the ergodic capacity of an n r ×1 MISO channel with total power constraint n r P .\nLet the transmitted signal X be a single-layer code with rate R = ln (1 + P s). In the MISO channel, the maximum throughput in Eq. (1) can be rewritten as\nFor transmission rate R, the throughput is R s = P out (R)R, where P out (R) is the outage probability of a ﬁxed transmission rate R. It is proved in [4] that the optimum transmit strategy minimizing the outage probability is to send uncorrelated cir- cularly symmetric zero mean equal power complex Gaussian signals from a fraction of antennas. Thus, here, one can restrict the transmit covariance matrix Q to diagonal matrices whose diagonal entries are either zero or a constant subject to the total power constraint P .\nIn following, Theorem 1 proves that the optimum solution with respect to R, denoted by R o , maximizing P out (R)R is less than ln (1 + P ). In this range of the transmission rate, the optimum transmit strategy which minimizes the outage probability and consequently, maximizes the throughput is to use all available antennas. Equation (6) yields the maximum throughput of an n t × 1 MISO block Rayleigh fading channel.\nTheorem 1 In a single-layer n t × 1 MISO block Rayleigh fading channel, the optimum transmit covariance matrix which\nI n t . The maximum throughput is given by\nAs pointed out above, we can restrict our attention to assume that l t out of n t transmit antennas are active and perform equal power allocation. Equation (5) is simpliﬁed to\n. The ﬁrst derivative of R s (s) = F a (l t s ) ln (1 + P s) with respect to s is\n \nR \u2032 s (s) > 0 iff r (s) > g(s, P ), R \u2032 s (s) = 0 iff r (s) = g(s, P ), R \u2032 s (s) < 0 iff r (s) < g(s, P ).\nFor positive integer arguments of m, Γ(m, x) = (m − 1)!e −x m −1 ℓ =0 x ℓ ℓ ! . Inserting the above equation into Eq. (12) yields\nOn the other hand, the ﬁrst derivative of g (s, P ) with respect to P is\nTherefore, g (s, P ) is a strictly increasing function with respect to P . As a result,\nComparing Eq. (14), Eq. (16), lim s →0 r (s) = + ∞, and g (0, P ) = 0, we get\nr (s) < g(s, P ) s ≥ 1. \t (17) Inserting Eq. (17) into Eq. (11) yields\nR \u2032 s (s) < 0 s ≥ 1. \t (18) Since R s (s) is a continuous function, according to Eq. (18),\nfor all positive integer values of l t and positive values of P , one can conclude that R s (s) takes its maximum at 0 < s o < 1.\nJorswieck and Boche [4] proved that when P > e R − 1, or equivalently s < 1, the optimum transmission strategy to minimize the outage probability is to use all available antennas with equal power allocation. Since ∀l t , 0 < s o < 1, the optimum strategy maximizing the throughput is to use all available antennas and perform equal power allocation. The maximum throughput is given by Eq. (6).\nRemark 1 In point-to-point single-input single-output (SISO) channels, by substituting n t = 1 in Eq. (6), the optimum solution with respect to s is s o = 1 W\n− 1 P , where W 0 ( ·) is the zero branch of the Lambert W-function. Therefore,\nRemark 2 Note that g (s, P ) is a strictly increasing function with respect to s and P , and r (s) is a strictly decreasing function with respect to s and increases with the number of antennas. Therefore, the solution to r (s) = g (s, P ), i.e., s o ,\n\u2022 increases with n t . In asymptotically large number of transmit antennas, s o → 1.\nAs a byproduct result of Theorem 1 and remark 2, we have the following.\nCorollary 1 In the asymptotically large number of transmit antennas MISO channel, the maximum throughput is given by\nRemark 3 In a correlated MISO channel wherein the trans- mitter does neither know the CSI nor the channel correlation, the outage probability is a Schur-convex (resp. Schur-concave) function of the channel covariance matrix for P > e R − 1 (resp. P < e R −1 2 ) [4]. According to Theorem 1, in the maximum throughput of the MISO channel, we have e R o −1 < P . Hence, in this range of the transmission rate, R s is a Schur-concave function of the channel covariance matrix, i.e., channel correlation decreases the throughput. In terms of the impact of correlation in the MISO channel with uninformed transmitter, the behavior of the maximum throughput is similar to the behavior of the ergodic capacity which is also a Schur- concave function of the channel covariance matrix [11].\nA block fading channel can be modeled by an equiva- lent broadcast channel whose receiver channels represent any fading coefﬁcient realization. The expected-rate of a fading channel is equal to a weighted sum-rate of its equivalent broadcast channel in which the weights distribution is the complementary CDF (tail distribution) of the channel gain [6]. In broadcast channels, any maximum weighted sum- rate with positive value weights is on the capacity region [5]. Since superposition (multi-layer) coding achieves the capacity region of degraded broadcast channels, it is the optimum coding strategy to maximize the average achievable rate in any block fading channel whose equivalent broadcast channel is degraded [6]. An example for such channels is the SISO channel. Although multi-layer coding is not the optimum coding strategy in MISO channels, it increases the average achievable rate of the channel. Numerical results for the continuous-layer expected-rate of MISO and SIMO block Rayleigh fading channels were presented in [12]. Here, the optimum transmit covariance matrix at each code layer is obtained, and consequently, the maximum expected-rate of the MISO channel is analytically formulated. Note that the maximum expected-rate of the SIMO channel with n t receive antennas can be calculated using the same formula by replacing P with n t P in Theorem 3.\nIn order to enhance the lucidity of this section, we divide it into two subsections. Section IV-A presents the maximum expected-rate of the MISO channel when a ﬁnite-layer code is transmitted. The more code layers, the higher expected- rate. Hence, a continuous-layer (inﬁnite-layer) code yields the highest expected-rate of the channel. The maximum continuous-layer expected-rate of the MISO channel is derived in Section IV-B in closed form.\nIn ﬁnite-layer coding approach, the transmitter sends a K- layer code X = K i =1 X i . Let P i be the signal power in the i\u2019th layer with rate R i = ln 1 + P i s i 1+I i s i , where I i =\nj =i+1 P j is the power of the upper layers while decoding the i\u2019th layer. The maximum expected-rate in Eq. (2) is simpliﬁed\nTheorem 2 presents the optimum covariance matrix in each layer which maximizes the expected-rate in the MISO channel.\nTheorem 2 In a ﬁnite-layer n t × 1 MISO block Rayleigh fading channel, the optimum transmit covariance matrix in each layer which maximizes the expected-rate is Q o i = P i n\nI n t , where P i is the power allocated to the i\u2019th layer. The maximum K-layer expected-rate is given by\nProof: Since the outage probability does not depend on the directions of the transmit covariance matrix Q [13], the problem is diagonalized. Therefore, the expected-rate received at the destination is simpliﬁed to\nwhere δ ℓ and η ℓ are the power fraction and upper-layer interference portion at the ℓ\u2019th antenna, respectively, subject to n t ℓ =1 δ ℓ = n t ℓ =1 η ℓ =1. Equation (23) can be rewritten as\nAs \t n t ℓ =1 (δ ℓ + s i I i δ ℓ − s i I i η ℓ ) = 1, to minimize Pr n t ℓ =1 (δ ℓ + s i I i δ ℓ − s i I i η ℓ ) |h ℓ | 2 < s i , \t ∀i, \t the optimum value of δ ℓ + s i I i δ ℓ − s i I i η ℓ must be either zero or a constant independent of ℓ for any positive value of s i . Hence, up to now, the optimum solution to Eq. (24) is to choose either δ ℓ = η ℓ = 1 l ti or δ ℓ = η ℓ = 0, that is to use l t i out of n t antennas with power P i l\nin each layer. Therefore, Eq. (24) is simpliﬁed to\n \n \nwhere a i = l ti ℓ =1 |h ℓ | 2 . In the remainder of the proof, we shall show that the optimum solution with respect to l t i is l o t i = n t , ∀i. Analogous to the throughput case in Theorem 1, let us deﬁne\nNote that g (0, P i , I i ) = 0, lim s i →0 r (s i ) = + ∞, and Eqs. (11) and (14) still hold by redeﬁning R s (s i ), r(s i ), and g(s i , P i , I i ) as above, and with s replaced by s i .\n, from Eq. (16) and noting I i s i ≥ 0, we have\nTherefore, Eqs. (17) and (18) still hold with the above functions, and lead to 0 < s o i < 1. This directly corresponds to the proof of Theorem 1 and shows that the optimum power allocation strategy is to use all available antennas with equal power allocation in each layer, i.e., Q o i = P i n t I n t , and the maximum expected-rate is given by Eq. (22).\nIn the continuous-layer coding, a.k.a. broadcast approach, a continuum of code layers is transmitted. Similar to ﬁnite-layer coding in Section IV-A, the receiver decodes the signal from the lowest layer up to the layer that the channel condition allows. Theorem 3 yields a closed form expression for the maximum continuous-layer expected-rate in the MISO channel by optimizing the power distribution over the layers. Due to space limitations, the proof is offered in [10].\nTheorem 3 In the MISO block Rayleigh fading channel, the maximum continuous-layer expected-rate obtained by opti- mizing the power distribution over the layers is given by R m c = R(s 1 ) − R(s 0 ), where\nRemark 4 By substituting n t = 1 in Theorem 3, the maximum continuous-layer expected-rate of the SISO channel is\nAs pointed out earlier, one can model a point-to-point block Rayleigh fading channel with an equivalent broadcast channel. According to the degradedness of the equivalent SISO broad- cast channel, and the optimality of superposition (multi-layer) coding for such channels, the maximum continuous-layer expected-rate of the SISO channel, i.e., Eq. (31), represents its maximum average achievable rate [6].\nRemark 5 By substituting n t = 2 in Theorem 3, the maximum continuous-layer expected-rate of a 2 × 1 MISO channel is\nRemark 6 Since the equivalent broadcast channel of the MISO channel is not degraded, its maximum continuous- layer expected-rate is not the maximum average achievable rate of the channel. For example, in asymptotically low SNR regime, the multiple-access scheme provides a higher average achievable rate in the MISO channel. In the multiple-access scheme, the antennas send independent messages, and the receiver decodes as much as it can.\nRemark 7 Similar to remark 3, one can conclude that for 0 < s o i < 1, ∀i, the maximum expected-rate of the MISO channel with uninformed transmitter is a Schur-concave function of the channel covariance matrix, that is channel correlation reduces the maximum expected-rate."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"G.
