Golay sequence, zero periodic autocorrelation zone, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing.\nIn modern communications, sequences with good auto- correlation property are desired for receiver synchronization and detection purposes. In 1961, Golay proposed the idea of aperiodic complementary sequence pair [4], of which the sum of out-of-phase aperiodic autocorrelation equals to zero. Later on, Davis and Jedwab formulated a method for con- structing such pairs using generalized boolean functions [2], which are called GDJ Golay pairs. Because of this correlation property, Golay complementary sequences have been utilized to construct Hadamard matrix for DS CDMA system [12], and to control the peak envelope power (PEP) in orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system [15], [16], [17], [18].\nThe utilization of Golay sequences in the two above sce- narios are based on the property of the sum of out-of- phase autocorrelation of the pair equals to zero. However, synchronization and detection of the signal is equivalent to computing its own autocorrelation. In this case, the autocorre- lation of single sequence is of our interest. Our motivation is to examine the property of Golay sequences when it is being utilized in this scenario. More speciﬁcally, if single Golay sequences inherit some ﬁxed, attractive autocorrelation property which can be exploited during detection and thus improve the performance of the system.\nIn quasi-synchronous code-division multiple-access (QS- CDMA) system, zero correlation zone (ZCZ) sequences can be used to eliminate or reduce the multiple access interference and multipath interference [9]. As a result, the construction of new ZCZ sequences for QS-CDMA system has received much researchers\u2019s attention [1], [3], [6], [7], [8], [10], [11], [13], [14], [19].\nIn this paper, we intend to consider the zero autocorrelation zone of binary and quaternary GDJ Golay sequences.\nLet H be a positive integer and ξ be the primitive H- th root of unity, i.e., ξ = exp(2π\n√ −1/H). For a sequence a = (a 0 , a 1 , · · · , a N−1 ) over Z H with period N, its aperiodic autocorrelation function and periodic autocorrelation function are respectively deﬁned by\nIf the periodic autocorrelation function of a is equal to zero with a range 0 < |u| ≤ L, where L is a positive integer, then the sequence a has a zero autocorrelation zone of length 2L.\nLet a and b be two sequences over Z H with period N. The sequences a and b are called a Golay complementary pair if C a (u) + C b (u) = 0 for any 1 ≤ u ≤ n − 1. Any one of them is called a Golay sequence.\nA generalized Boolean function f(x 1 , · · · , x m ) with m variables is a mapping from Z m 2 to Z 2 h , h ≥ 1, which has an unique representation as a multiple polynomial over Z 2 h of the special form:\nThis is called the algebraic normal form of f. The algebraic degree is deﬁned by the maximum value of the size I with a I = 0.\nLet (i 1 , · · · , i m ) be the binary representation of the integer i = m k=1 i k 2 m−k . A Boolean function f(x 1 , · · · , x m ) can also be regarded as the output column of its truth table, i.e., a binary string of length 2 m , where the i-th element of the string is equal to f(i 1 , · · · , i m ). For example, m = 3, we have\nf = (f(0, 0, 0), f(0, 0, 1), f(0, 1, 0), f(0, 1, 1), f(1, 0, 0), f(1, 0, 1), f(1, 1, 0), f(1, 1, 1)).\nNaturally, a generalized Boolean function can be regarded as a sequence of length 2 m over Z 2 h . In [2], by using the quadratic generalized Boolean functions, Davis and Jedwab constructed Golay complementary pairs as follows.\nTheorem 1 (Theorem 3, [2]): Let m ≥ 2 be a positive integer and n = 2 m . Deﬁne a sequence a = (a i ) over Z 2 h of length n\nwhere π is a permutation from {1, 2, · · · , m} to itself and c i ∈ Z 2 h , i = 0, 1, · · · , m. Then the sequences a i and a i + 2 h−1 i π(1) + c are a Golay pair of length 2 m for any c ∈ Z 2 h .\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section III, we will present a class of binary Golay sequence with a large zero autocorrelation zone of length 2 m−1 . In Section IV, we will illustrate this zero autocorrelation zone with a few examples. We will also extend the binary case into quaternary case, and empirically show that the zero autocorrelation zone also exists for quaternary Golay sequences.\nIn the following, we will present a class of binary Golay sequence with a zero autocorrelation zone of length 2 m−1 .\nTheorem 2: Using the same notation as Theorem 1, let π be a permutation of {1, 2, · · · , m} with π(1) = 1 and π(2) = 2, and h = 1. Then the binary sequence (a i ) given by (1) has C a (u) = 0 for any u ∈ U, where\nIn other words, those sequences have a zero autocorrelation zone 2 m−1 .\nProof: Note that R a (u) = R a (n − u) for any u. So it is sufﬁcient to prove\nIn the following, for any given u ∈ {k : 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 m−2 } and an integer i, set j = i+u( mod n) and let (i 1 , i 2 , · · · , i m ) and (j 1 , j 2 , · · · , j m ) be the binary representations of i and j, respectively.\nThe set {i : 0 ≤ i < n} can be divided into four disjoint subsets:\nI 2 (u) = {0 ≤ i < n : i π(1) = j π(1) , i π(m) = j π(m) }; I 3 (u) = 0 ≤ i < n : i π(1) = j π(1) , i π(2) = j π(2) , i\nFirst we will show that the subset I 4 (u) is an empty set. In this case, i π(1) = j π(1) indicates that:\n(i) i π(1) = 0 and j π(1) = 1; or (ii) i π(1) = 1 and j π(1) = 0.\n(i) In this case, one has j > j π(1) 2 m−1 = 2 m−1 > i since π(1) = 1, i π(1) = 0 and j π(1) = 1, i.e., j > i. This together with j − i ≡ u(mod n) indicates that j = i + u. While one also has\n(ii) In this case, one has i > i π(1) 2 m−1 = 2 m−1 > j since π(1) = 1, i π(1) = 1 and j π(1) = 0, i.e., j < i. This together with j − i ≡ u(mod n) indicates that j = i + u − n. While one also has\ni.e., j > i + u − n. This also contradicts with j = i + u − n. By the discussion above, the set I 4 (u) is an empty set. Then\nthe autocorrelation function R a (u) given by (2) can be written as\nLet i ∈ I 1 (u) = {0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1 : i π(1) = j π(1) }. Since j = i, we can deﬁne v as follows:\nIt is easy to show v ≥ 2. Let i and j be two integers with binary representations deﬁned by\nπ(k) , k = v − 1 and\nIn other words, i and j are obtained from i and j by \u201cﬂipping\u201d the (v − 1)-th bit in (i π(1) , · · · , i π(m) ) and (j π(1) , · · · , j π(m) ). It is easy to show that j − i = j − i ≡ u(mod n). Let I 1 (u) be the set of the set of corresponding i ∈ I 1 (u). Note that the following fact holds.\n2) The mapping from I 1 (u) to I 1 (u) is a one-to-one mapping.\nHence we can conclude that I 1 (u) = I 1 (u). Given i, j, i , j , we have\nThis equality indicates that (−1) a i −a j /(−1) a i −a j = −1, and then\nLet i ∈ I 2 (u) = {0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1 : i π(1) = j π(1) , i π(m) = j π(m) }. In this case, let i and j be the two integers with binary representations deﬁned by\nLet I 2 (u) be the set corresponding to i ∈ I 2 (u). Using the same argument as case i ∈ I 1 (u), we can obtain the following.\n1) i π(1) = j π(1) , i π(m) = j π(m) , and j − i = j − i ≡ u(mod n).\n3) (−1) a i −a j + (−1) a i −a j = 0. Hence equality (5) holds.\nLet i ∈ I 3 (u) = {0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1 : i π(1) = j π(1) , i π(2) = j π(2) , i π(m) = j π(m) }. In this case, let i and j be two integers with binary representations deﬁned by\nLet I 3 (u) be the set corresponding to i ∈ I 3 (u). Also using the same argument as case i ∈ I 1 (u), we get the following.\n1) i π(1) = j π(1) , i π(2) = j π(2) , i π(m) = j π(m) , and j −i ≡ j − i ≡ u(mod n).\nIn this section, we will give 6 examples and discuss their zero autocorrelation zone. The ﬁrst 3 examples are binary Golay sequences and the last 3 examples are quaternary Golay sequences. For binary Golay sequence, h in (1) is equal to 1. For quaternary Golay sequence, h in (1) is equal to 2.\nExample 1: Let m = 5 and π be an identity permutation from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} to itself, (c k ) 5 k=0 = (0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0). The sequence a given by (1) is a = (0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0). Then one has (R a (u)) 31 u=1 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, −4, 0, −4, 0, −12, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, −12, 0, −4, 0, −4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0). It is easy to see that the sequence a has a zero autocorrelation zone of 16. See Figure 1.\nExample 2: Let m = 5 and π be a permutation that maps (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) to (2, 1, 3, 5, 4), (c k ) 5 k=0 = (0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0). The sequence a given by (1) is a = (0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0).\nThen one has (R a (u)) 31 u=1 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, −8, 4, 0, −4, −8, −4, 0, −4, −8, −4, 0, 4, −8, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0).\nIt is easy to see that the sequence a also has a zero autocorrelation zone of 16. See Figure 2.\nExample 3: Let m = 5 and π be a permutation that maps (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) to (2, 3, 4, 1 , 5), (c k ) 5 k=0 = (0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0). The sequence a given by (1) is a = (0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0). Then one\nhas (R a (u)) 31 u=1 = (0, 0, −4, 0, −4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, −12, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, −12, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, −4, 0, −4, 0, 0). It is easy to see that the sequence a has a zero autocorrelation zone of 4. See Figure 3.\nIt can be observed that in the ﬁrst two cases of binary Golay sequences, the autocorrelation of the ﬁrst quarter and last quarter phase shift is exactly 0. This implies they have a zero autocorrelation zone of length 2 m−1 = 16. The permutation for Example 1 falls within Theorem 2. However, the permutation for Example 2 does not. The Example 3 does not exhibit this relation.\nIn conclusion, there are more cases that also possess large zero autocorrelation zone and which are not characterized by Theorem 2. We will include a detailed discussion on those cases in the full version of this work [5].\nExample 4: Let m = 5 and π be an identity permutation from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} to itself, (c k ) 5 k=0 = (0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0). The sequence a given by (1) is a = (0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 0, 2). Then one has (R a (u)) 31 u=1 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4j, 0, 4j, 0, 12j, 0, −4j, 0, 4j, 0, −12j, 0, −4j, 0, −4j, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), where j = √\n−1. It is easy to see that the sequence a has a zero autocorrelation zone of 16. See Figure 4.\nExample 5: Let m = 5 and π be a permutation that maps (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) to (2, 1, 3, 5, 4), (c k ) 5 k=0 = (0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0). The sequence a given by (1) is a = (0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1,\n0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2). Then one has (R a (u)) 31 u=1 = (2j, 4j, 2j, 0, 2j, 4j, −6j, 0, −2j, −4j, 6j, 0, −2j, −4j, −2j, 0, 2j, 4j, 2j, 0, −6j, 4j, 2j, 0, 6j, −4j,\n−2j, 0, −2j, −4j, −2j), where j = √ −1. It is easy to see that the sequence a has no zero autocorrelation zone. See Figure 5.\nExample 6: Let m = 5 and π be a permutation that maps (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) to (2, 3, 4, 1, 5), (c k ) 5 k=0 = (0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0). The sequence a given by (1) is a = (0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 0, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 0, 0, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 0, 2). Then one has (R a (u)) 31 u=1 = (0, 0, 4, 0, 4 + 8j, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, −4 − 8j, 0, −4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, −4, 0, −4+8j, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4−8j, 0, 4, 0, 0), where j =\nNote that for the ﬁgures of quaternary Golay sequences, autocorrelation R a (u) is taken in the form of magnitude. This is because autocorrelation of quaternary Golay sequences contains both real part and imaginary part.\nFor quaternary Golay sequences, it can be observed that even though the permutation and constants are exactly the same as binary case, their autocorrelation distribution is some- what different. The ﬁrst quaternary case still exhibits the zero autocorrelation zone of length 2 m−1 . This however, no longer holds true for the second case. The third quaternary case, similar to the third binary case, only has a zero autocorrelation zone of length 4.\nWe have shown that there exists Golay sequences with selected permutations and constants which will contain zero autocorrelations zones of length 2 m−1 for both binary and quaternary cases. The binary case is proved theoretically, and the quaternary case is demonstrated by experimental results.\nGolay sequences with this property can have wide implica- tions for synchronization and detection at the receiver end. If the synchronization of system is guaranteed to occur within the zero autocorrelation zone, then early synchronization or late synchronization caused by multi path interference will have no impact on the performance of the system. There will only be a peak value at 0-th phase shift(i.e., correct timing synchronization). Thus the synchronization of system can be achieved.\nAs shown by experimental results in Section IV, there are some other cases of binary Golay sequences with a large zero autocorrelation zone, and some classes of quaternary Golay sequences also exhibit this property. Further ﬁndings about this property will be included in the full version of this work [5]. We also ﬁnd large zero odd periodic correlation zone for H-ary Golay sequences and 4 q -QAM Golay sequences, which will be introduced in a separate paper."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"X. M.
