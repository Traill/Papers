These measures known as manifestly positive algebraic measures and their properties were ﬁrst studied in [1]. Algebraic measures are classical analogues of ﬁnitely correlated states in quantum spin systems [2]. We use the properties of the algebraic measures to give formulas for the entropy rate of a hidden Markov process derived from a certain noise model that we will describe later.\nn \t (1) where µ is the measure associated with the sequence of ran- dom variables. This limit exits when {X n } forms a stationary stochastic process. There is a well known formula for the entropy rate of a Markov source, however the problem of deriving explicit expressions for the entropy rate of the is still an open issue. The entropy rate of a hidden Markov process was ﬁrst studied by Blackwell in 1957 [3] who showed that the entropy rate is given by the integral with respect to a function on a simplex with respect to a measure called the Blackwell measure. Recently there has been a renewed interest in problem of calculating the entropy rate of a hidden Markov chain [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. The algebraic measure approach to functions of Markov process can be compared to previous work in [10], [11] and recently to [12]. In [3] Blackwell derived a formula for a three state hidden Markov process which has one unambiguous symbol. The hidden Markov model we work with is a generalization of Blackwell, moreover we also show that approximate formula we give converges exponentially fast to the entropy rate.\nLet q ∈ N and K = {0, 1, ..., q − 1} and consider the chain Ω = K Z consisting of conﬁgurations ω = (..., ω i , ω i+1 , ...)\nwith each w i ∈ K. Let F K be the sigma algebra generated by all the cylinder sets. In [1] a special class of translation- invariant measures called algebraic measures was constructed on F K in terms of a triplet (U, ρ, (E a ) a∈K ) where\n\u2022 U is a real ordered algebra (the order determined by a proper convex cone U + ).\n\u2022 E a ∈ U + satisfying ρ(AE) = ρ(EA) = ρ(A), ∀ A ∈ U , ρ(E) = 1 where E = a∈K E a .\nProposition 2.1: Given the triplet (U, ρ, (E a ) a∈K ) there exists a unique translation invariant probability measure µ on F K such that\nLet M + d be the positive cone in the algebra of d × d real matrices M d consisting of matrices with positive entries and (R d ) + be d × 1 column vectors with positive entries. An algebraic measure µ is called manifestly positive if there exists a d ∈ N, a positive τ and σ ∈ (R d ) + and for each a ∈ K, a E a ∈ M + d such that\nwhere τ | σ = τ T σ is the usual inner product on R d . In [1] a one-one correspondence was shown between functions of Markov processes (hidden Markov models) and the class of manifestly positive algebraic measures. Let X = {X i } i∈N be a Markov chain that takes values on a ﬁnite alphabet L with transition matrix E and stationary measure ν. Let F a be the matrix with the only non-vanishing row equal to the a th row of E. Thus\nLet Y = {Y i } i∈N be a noisy observation of the Markov chain with values in K = {0, 1, ..., q − 1}. Deﬁne the matrix R = [r ab ] with r ab = P r[Y i = a|X i = b] and let\nIt is easy to verify that the manifestly positive representation of the stationary measure µ associated with Y is (τ, σ, (E a ) a∈K ). So that\nwhere τ a = µ(a) and σ is a vector with all components equal to 1.\nIt was shown that under certain irreducibility conditions (see Condition 1 in [1]) the entropy rate of a manifestly positive algebraic measure can be computed as an integral with respect to a measure on the simplex W = {w = (w 1 , w 2 , ..., w q ) : w i ≥ 0, w i = 1} similar to the Blackwell measure. We have the following theorem for the entropy rate of a function of Markov process.\nTheorem 2.2 ([1]): The entropy rate H(µ) of a manifestly positive algebraic measure µ (satisfying Condition 1) is given by\nwhere h a (w) = − w | E a σ log w | E a σ and φ(dw) is a probability measure on the simplex W.\nif νE a | σ = 0 0 \t otherwise\nwhere E \u2020 a is the adjoint of E a . Let C 0 (W 0 ) be the set of continuous real valued functions that vanish on 0, then T µ : C 0 (W 0 ) → C 0 (W 0 ) is deﬁned by\nIn [1] the measure φ(dw) was characterized as the unique measure on C(W) that is invariant under T µ ,i.e.,\nwhere Γ (ω) = Γ ω n−1 · · · Γ ω 0 and ¯ τ is the only non-trivial ﬁxed point of Γ a 0 .\nIn this section we describe the noise model and the support of the measure φ(dw) given by equation (9) for this noise model. If the symbol 0 is transmitted then it is always received as 0 at the other end. On the other hand if any of the other symbol is transmitted then it is either received without any error or received as the symbol 0 with a small error probability. That is P (Y i = 0|X i = 0) = 1, P (Y i = 0|X i = a) = a and P (Y i = a|X i = a) = 1 − a for a = 1, ..., q − 1 and P (Y i = b|X i = a) = 0 when 0 = b = a. Here we consider the symbols 1, 2, ..., q − 1 to be unambiguous, since if any one of them is received then that same symbol must have been transmitted. See ﬁgure 1 for a description of the model in the special case of q = 3.\nLet the matrices {F a } be the matrices that describe the uncorrupted Markov source as in equation (2). For this noise\nLet e i , i = 0, 1..., q − 1 denote the transpose of the (i + 1) st row of E = [e ij ]. Let p = min ij e ij and P = max ij e ij . Our only assumption will be\n. Because of Assumption 1 we get\nA key factor that simpliﬁes our analysis of the entropy rate is that the support of φ(dw) given by equation (9) simpliﬁes signiﬁcantly with this noise model. We have the following proposition about the support of the measure φ.\nProof: Since by equation (12) ¯ τ ∈ (R q ) + , it follows from equation (13) that Γ a ¯ τ = e a and Γ a e a = e a for a = 0. Therefore by (9)\nOne can show ([1] equation (28)) that for any ν ∈ W + there exists constants C 1 and ρ < 1 such that\nThis implies that all subsequences in ∆ converge to ¯ τ and hence ¯ τ is the only accumulation point in ∆. Therefore\n∆ can be countably inﬁnite as can be seen from the following lemma.\nLemma 3.2: If E \u2020 0 is one to one then ∆ is countably inﬁnite set of distinct elements.\nProof: We will ﬁrst show that E \u2020 0 is one-one =⇒ Γ 0 : W → W is one-one.\nand since ν, η ∈ W therefore C = 1 so ν = η. Observe from equation (11) that if E \u2020 0 is one-one then the vectors e a ∈ W, a ∈ K form a linearly independent set. We will show that all the elements of ∆ are distinct ,i.e., for any m, n ≥ 0\nΓ m 0 e i = Γ n 0 e j \t (17) Γ m 0 e i = ¯ τ\nAssume Γ m 0 e i = Γ n 0 e j for some m, n ≥ 0 and for i, j ∈ {1, ..., q − 1}, If m and n are both zero then e i = e j but this contradicts the fact that e j \u2019s form a linearly independent set. Assume wlog that m > n. Since Γ 0 is one-one we arrive at Γ k 0 e i = e j for k = m−n. Again using equation (11) we arrive at a contradiction that e j \u2019s form a linearly independent set.\nFrom above, Γ 0 e a = e a for any a ∈ K so e a = ¯ τ . If Γ m 0 e a = ¯ τ for some m ≥ 1 then Γ 0 (Γ m−1 0 e a ) = ¯ τ . Since ¯ τ is a ﬁxed point of Γ 0 and Γ 0 is one to one we conclude that (Γ m−1 0 )e a = ¯ τ . Repeating the argument we get e a = ¯ τ which again is a contradiction.\nProof: Since ∆ is countably inﬁnite there exists a j ∈ {1, ..., q − 1} such that lim m→∞ Γ m 0 e j = ¯ τ . Consider the set\nf m (ν) = 1 ν ∈ ∆ j,m 0 otherwise\nwhere we used (13) and the fact that Γ 0 ν ∈ ∆ m only if ν ∈ ∆ m−1 . We have\nFrom Assumption 1 we have ν | E 0 σ < 1 and ∆ j,m−1 being a compact set we get\nIn this section we apply the results on manifestly positive algebraic measures in II to the case of the hidden Markov model described in section III. Deﬁne\nwhere the entries of R are the tails ((N + 1) st term onwards) of the entries of A. Let ˆ Φ be the least square solution to\nTheorem 4.1: Under Assumption 1 and if E \u2020 0 is one-one the entropy rate of the measure µ associated with the hidden Markov process with the noise model described in section III is given by\nMoreover the entropy rate can be approximated to O(γ N +1 ) by\n1 if ν = Γ m 0 e j 0 otherwise\nBut Γ a (ν) = e a and Γ 0 ν = Γ m 0 e j only if ν = Γ m−1 0 e j therefore\nSimilarly we use the functions f j,0 to solve for φ(e 1 ),...,φ(e q−1 ).\nEquations (26) and (27) form a system of q linear equations AΦ = b with A ∈ M q,q−1 , Φ ∈ R q−1 and b ∈ R q as given by (19),(20). By lemma (4.2) ∞ m=0 c j,m < ∞ which ensures that each A ij is bounded. Now from the integral formula for the entropy rate given by (5) and the support of the measure given by proposition (3.1) we get that\n1 − γ Φ − ˆ Φ j 1 By lemma 4.3\nNow, by (12) and Assumption 1, a < 1 if a ∈ {1, .., q − 1} and 0 = 1.

Let q = 3,\n0.4 0.25 0.35 0.25 0.45 0.3\nWe note that the computational complexity of the formula is exponential in N , but since the error goes to zero expo- nentially fast we require only a small number of terms in the computation which leads to a practically more useful formula than other methods, for eg. using H N = lim N →∞ S N −S N −1 .\nIn this paper we used algebraic measures to compute an exact formula for a the entropy rate of hidden Markov model and showed that the formula converges exponentially fast. The noise model we studied was very speciﬁc and it would be interesting to see if the techniques of algebraic measures can be generalized to a larger class of noise models. Computing the corresponding entropic entities like Von Neumann entropy and capacities of correlated quantum channels described by ﬁnitely correlated states in quantum spin systems would be very important from the point of view of quantum information theory.\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the NSF grant Award #1009502."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"M.
