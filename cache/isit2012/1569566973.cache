We further assume the existence of another set of terminals in the system, called helpers, who are not interested in the common ﬁle, but who are willing to help the users. Given that the collective information of all the terminals is sufﬁcient to allow recovery of the entire ﬁle, the goal is to minimize the (weighted) sum of bits that these terminals need to exchange over a noiseless public channel in order achieve this goal. Based on established connections to the multi-terminal secrecy problem, our algorithm also implies a polynomial-time method for constructing the largest shared secret key in the presence of an eavesdropper. We consider the following side-information settings: (i) side-information in the form of uncoded packets of the ﬁle, where the terminals\u2019 side-information consists of subsets of the ﬁle packets; (ii) side-information in the form of linearly correlated packets, where the terminals have access to linear combinations of the ﬁle packets; and (iii) the general setting where the the terminals\u2019 side-information has an arbitrary (i.i.d.) correlation structure.

At the same time, the rapid growth in the popularity of data-enabled mobile devices, such as smart phones and tablets, and the resulting explosion in demand for more throughput are challenging our abilities to deliver data, even with the current highly efﬁcient cellular systems. One of the major bottlenecks in scaling the throughput with the increasing number of mobile devices is the \u201clast mile\u201d wireless link between the base station and the mobile devices \u2013 a resource that is shared among many terminals served within the cell. This motivates the study of paradigms where cell phone devices can cooperate among themselves to get the desired data in a peer-to-peer fashion without solely relying on the base station.\nAn example of such a setting is shown in Figure 1, where a base station wants to deliver the same ﬁle to mul- tiple geographically-close users over an unreliable wireless downlink. We assume that some terminals, which are in the proximity of the users, are not interested in the ﬁle, but are able to overhear some of the base station transmissions. Moreover, we assume that these terminals are willing to help in distributing the ﬁle to the interested users. Henceforth, we refer to these terminals as helpers, and the terminals interested in the ﬁle as users. In the example of Figure 1 we assume that the ﬁle consists of four equally sized packets w 1 , w 2 , w 3 and w 4 belonging to some ﬁnite ﬁeld F q n . Suppose that after a few initial transmission attempts by the base station, the three terminals (including one helper) individually receive only parts of the ﬁle (see Figure 1), but collectively have the entire ﬁle. Now, if all terminals are in close vicinity and can communicate with each other, then, it is much more desirable and efﬁcient, in terms of resource usage, to reconcile the ﬁle among users by letting all terminals \u201ctalk\u201d to each other without involving the base station. The cooperation among the terminals has the following advantages:\n\u2022 Local communication among terminals has a smaller footprint in terms of interference, thus allowing one to use the shared resources (code, time or frequency) freely without penalizing the base station\u2019s resources, i.e., higher resource reuse factor.\n\u2022 Transmissions within the close group of terminals is much more reliable than from the base station to any\n\u2022 This cooperation allows for the ﬁle recovery even when the connection to the base station is either unavailable after the initial phase of transmission, or it is too weak to meet the delay requirement.\nThe problem of reconciling a ﬁle among multiple wireless users having parts of it while minimizing the cost in terms of the total number of bits exchanged is known in the literature as the data exchange problem and was introduced by El Rouayheb et al. in [1]. In the problem formulation of the data exchange problem it is assumed that all the terminals in the system are interested in recovering the entire ﬁle, i.e., there are no helpers. For this problem randomized algorithms were proposed in [2] and [3], while deterministic polynomial time algorithms were proposed in [4], [5]. In [6], [7] and [8] the authors used a combinatorial approach, to solve this problem, which exploited the fact that the constraint set in the corresponding optimization problem forms a submodular base-polyhedron. For the problem considered in this paper, where not all terminals are interested in recovering the ﬁle, the constraint set does not constitute a submodular base- polyhedron. As a result, here, we take a convex optimization approach to solve the data exchange problem with helpers.\nTo exemplify the effect of having helpers, consider the example from Figure 1. Let user 1, user 2 and the helper transmit R 1 , R 2 and R 3 bits, respectively. The objective is to minimize the weighted sum-rate α 1 R 1 + α 2 R 2 + α 3 R 3 such that, user 1 and user 2 can recover the entire ﬁle. It can be shown that for the case when α 1 = α 2 = α 3 = 1, the minimum communication cost is 2 and can be achieved by the following coding scheme: user 2 transmits packet w 4 , and the helper transmits w 1 + w 3 , where the addition is over the underlying ﬁeld F q n . This corresponds to the optimal rate allocation R 2 = R 3 = 1 symbol in F q n . Now, if there was no helper in the system, it would take a total of 3 transmissions to reconcile the ﬁle among the two users. That is user 1 has to transmit w 3 and user 2 transmits w 1 and w 4 . Thus, the helpers can contribute to lowering the total communication cost in the system.\nThe discussion above considers only a simple form of side- information, where different terminals observe partial uncoded \u201craw\u201d packets of the original ﬁle. Content distribution net- works are increasingly using coding, such as Fountain codes or linear network codes, to improve the system efﬁciency [9]. In such scenarios, the side-information representing the partial knowledge gained by the terminals would be coded and in the form of linear combinations of the original ﬁle packets, rather than the raw packets themselves. The previous two cases of side-information (\u201craw\u201d and coded) can be regarded as special cases of the more general problem where the side-information has arbitrary correlation among the data observed by the differ- ent terminals and where the goal is to minimize the weighted total communication cost. In [10] Csisz´ar and Narayan posed a related security problem referred to as the \u201cmulti-terminal key agreement\u201d problem. They showed that obtaining the ﬁle among the users in minimum number of bits exchanged over\nthe public channel is sufﬁcient to maximize the size of the secret key shared between the users. This result establishes a connection between the Multi-party key agreement and the Data exchange problem with helpers. The authors in [10] solved the key agreement problem by formulating it as a linear program (LP) with an exponential number of rate-constraints, corresponding to all possible cut-sets that need to be satisﬁed.\nIn this paper, we make the following contributions. First, we provide a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for ﬁnding an optimal rate allocation, w.r.t. a linear weighted sum-rate cost needed to deliver the ﬁle to all users when all terminals have arbitrarily correlated side-information. Second, for the the data exchange problem with helpers, for raw or linearly coded side-information, we propose an efﬁcient communication scheme design based on the algebraic network coding framework [11], [12].\nIn this paper, we consider a setup with m terminals out of which some subset of them is interested in gaining access to a ﬁle or a random process. Let X 1 , X 2 , . . . , X m , m ≥ 2, denote the components of a discrete memoryless multiple source (DMMS) with a given joint probability mass function. Each user i ∈ M {1, 2, . . . , m} observes n i.i.d. realizations of the corresponding random variable X i .\nLet A = {1, 2, . . . , k} ⊆ M be the subset of terminals, called users, who are interested in gaining access to the ﬁle, i.e., learning the joint process X M \t (X 1 , . . . , X m ). The remaining terminals {k +1, . . . , m} serve as helpers, i.e., they are not interested in recovering the ﬁle, but they are willing to help users in the set A to obtain it. In [10], Csisz´ar and Narayan showed that to deliver the ﬁle to all users in a setup with general DMMS, interactive communication is not needed. As a result, in the sequel WLOG we can assume that the transmission of each user is only a function of its own initial observations. Let F i f i (X n i ) represent the transmission of the user i ∈ M, where f i (·) is any desired mapping of the observations X n i . For each user in A in order to recover the entire ﬁle, transmissions F i , i ∈ M, should satisfy,\nDeﬁnition 1. A rate vector R = (R 1 , R 2 , . . . , R m ) is an achievable data exchange (DE)-rate vector if there exists a communication scheme with transmitted messages F = (F 1 , F 2 , . . . , F m ) that satisﬁes (1), and is such that\nIt is easy to show using cut-set bounds that all the achievable DE-rate vectors necessarily belong to the following region\nwhere R( S) \t i∈S R i . Also, using a random coding argument, it can be shown that the rate region R is an achievable rate region [10].\nIn this work, we aim to design a polynomial complexity algorithm that delivers the ﬁle to all users in A while simul- taneously minimizing a linear communication cost function m\ni=1 α i R i , where α \t (α 1 , · · · , α m ), 0 ≤ α i < ∞, is an m −dimensional vector of non-negative ﬁnite weights. We allow α i \u2019s to be arbitrary non-negative constants, to account for the case when communication of some terminals is more expensive compared to the others, e.g., setting α 1 to be a large value compared to the other weights minimizes the rate allocated to the user 1. This goal can be formulated as the following linear program:\nIn this section we introduce a source-model to characterize linearly correlated side-information. The source model we use is called Finite linear source as deﬁned in [13]. It captures the fact that the content distribution networks using linear codes result in terminals\u2019 side-information to be in the form of linear combinations of the original packets instead of the uncoded packets, as is the case in conventional \u201cData Exchange problem\u201d.\nNext, we brieﬂy describe the ﬁnite linear source model. Let q be some power of a prime. Consider the N-dimensional random vector W ∈ F N q n whose components are independent and uniformly distributed over the elements of F q n . Then, in the linear source model, the observation of i th user is simply given by\nIt is easy to verify that for the ﬁnite linear source model, H(X i )\nHenceforth for the ﬁnite linear source model we will use the entropy of the observations and the rank of the observation matrix interchangeably.\nWe begin this section by exploring the case when the set A consists of only one user. Then, by using the methodology of [14], we extend our solution to the case when the set A has arbitrary number of users.\nLet there be only one user interested in obtaining the ﬁle, i.e., A = {1}. This is known as a multi-terminal Slepian- Wolf problem [15] for which the achievable rate region has the following form:\nHence, the underlying optimization problem has the following form\nOptimization problem (7) can be solved analytically due to the fact that the set function\nis supermodular (see [16] for the formal deﬁnition). Therefore, optimization problem (7) is over a supermodular polyhedron R 1 . From the combinatorial optimization theory it is known that Edmonds\u2019 greedy algorithm [17] provides an analytical solution to this problem (see Algorithm 1).\n1: Set j 1 , j 2 , . . . , j m−1 to be an ordering of M \\ {1} such that α j 1 ≤ α j 2 ≤ · · · ≤ α j m−1 .\nExample 1. Consider a system with m = 6 terminals M = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. For convenience, we express the underlying data vector as W = a b c T ∈ F 3 q n , where a, b, c are independent uniform random variables in F q n . Let us consider the case where each node has the following observations: X 1 = {a + b}, X 2 = {a + c}, X 3 = {b + c}, X 4 = {a}, X 5 = {b}, X 6 = {c}. Let us assume that user 1 is interested in recovering the vector W such that underlying communication cost is 6 i=2 R i .\nIt immediately follows from Algorithm 1 that a solution to this problem is R ∗ 4 = R ∗ 6 = 1, and R ∗ 2 = R ∗ 3 = R ∗ 5 = 0. In other words, user 1 is missing 2 linear equations in order to be able to decode all 3 data packets.\nWhen |A| > 1, the set of constraints of the optimization problem (4) does not constitute a polyhedron of a supermod- ular function, as it was the case when |A| = 1. The reason is that the possible set function is not deﬁned for all subsets of M. For that reason, in this section, we take a convex optimization approach to solve the problem (4), where we use the single user solution as a key building block.\nFirst, we observe that an achievable DE-rate vector Z has to simultaneously belong to the rate regions R l of each individual user l ∈ A, where\nThus, the rate region R deﬁned in (3) can be equivalently represented as\nTherefore, the optimal DE-rate vector Z ∗ can be obtained as follows\ns.t. Z i ≥ R (l) i , ∀l ∈ A, ∀i ∈ M \\ {l}, R (l) ∈ R l , ∀l ∈ A.\nOptimization problem (11) has an exponential number of constraints, which makes it challenging to solve in polynomial time. To obtain a polynomial time solution we consider the Lagrangian dual of problem (11).\nDual variable Λ in the above problem is represented in matrix form as follows.\n⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣\n⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥\nWe denote by Λ i and Λ (l) , the i th column vector and l th row vector of the matrix Λ, respectively. Moreover, we denote by\n⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣\n⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥\nthe rate matrix whose l th row, here denoted by ˜ R (l) , represents an optimizer of the problem (13) w.r.t. the weight vector Λ (l) . In order to ensure consistency with the optimization prob- lem (12) observe that λ (l) l = 0, and ˜ R (l) l = 0, ∀l = 1, . . . , k.\nFor any given user l ∈ A, the objective function (13) of the dual problem (12) can be computed analytically using Algorithm 1. The optimization problem (12) is a linear pro- gram (LP) with O(m · k) number of constraints, which makes it possible to solve it in polynomial time (w.r.t. number of terminals). To solve the optimization problem (12) we apply a subgradient method, as described below.\nStarting with a feasible iterate Λ[0] w.r.t. the optimization problem (12), every subsequent iterate Λ[η] can be recursively represented as an Euclidian projection of the vector\nonto the hyperplane Λ i ≥ 0| k l=1 λ (l) i = α i , where ˜ R i [η − 1] is the i th column of the rate matrix ˜ R[η − 1]. The Euclidian projection ensures that every iterate Λ[η] is feasible w.r.t. the optimization problem (12). It is not hard to verify that the following initial choice of Λ[0] is feasible.\n⎧ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎩\nα i k−1 if i ∈ A \\ {l} 0 \t if i = l\nBy appropriately choosing the step size θ[η] in each it- eration (16), it is guaranteed that the subgradient method described above converges to the optimal solution of the dual problem (12). To recover the primal optimal solution from the iterates Λ[η] we use results from [18], where at each iteration of (16), the primal iterate is constructed as follows.\nBy carefully choosing the step size θ[η], ∀η in (16) and the convex combination coefﬁcients µ (η) j , ∀j = 1, . . . , η, ∀η, it is guaranteed that (18) converges to the minimizer of (11), and therefore to the minimizer of the original problem (4). In [18], the authors proposed several choices for {θ[η]} and {µ (η) j } which lead to the primal recovery. Here we list some of them.\n1) θ[η] = a b+cη , ∀η, where a > 0, b ≥ 0, c > 0, µ (η) j = 1 η , ∀j = 1, . . . , η, ∀η,\n2) θ[η] = η −a , ∀η, where 0 < a < 1, µ (η) j = 1 η , ∀j = 1, . . . , η, ∀η.\nNow, it is only left to compute an optimal rate allocation w.r.t to the problem deﬁned in (4). Let R ∗ and Z ∗ be the optimal rate vectors of the problems (4) and (11), respectively. As we pointed out earlier R ∗ = Z ∗ , where Z ∗ can be computed from the matrix ˆ R[η] for a sufﬁciently large η, as follows\nIn this Section we brieﬂy address the question of the optimal code construction for the linear source model. For that matter, let us consider the following example.\nExample 2. Let us consider the same source model as in Example 1, where A = {1, 2, 3}, and the objective function is 6\ni=1 R i . Applying the algorithm described above, we obtain R ∗ 1 = R ∗ 2 = R ∗ 3 = 1 4 , R ∗ 4 = R ∗ 5 = R ∗ 6 = 1 2 . (21)\nThis solution suggests that in order to design a scheme that performs optimally, it is necessary to split all the packets into 4\nequally sized chunks. In other words, terminals\u2019 observations can be written as X 1 = a + b = {a 1 + b 1 , a 2 + b 2 , a 3 + b 3 , a 4 + b 4 }, X 2 = a + c = {a 1 + c 1 , a 2 + c 2 , a 3 + c 3 , a 4 + c 4 }, etc., where all a i \u2019s, b i \u2019s and c i \u2019s belong to F q n/4 . For this \u201cextended\u201d source model we have that the optimal rate allocation is R ∗ 1 = R ∗ 2 = R ∗ 3 = 1, R ∗ 4 = R ∗ 5 = R ∗ 6 = 2.\nNext question we need to address is how to design trans- missions of each user? Starting from an optimal (integer) rate allocation, we ﬁrst construct the corresponding multicast network (see Figure 2). In this construction, notice that there are several types of nodes. First, there is a super node S that possesses all the packets. Each user in the set A plays the role of a transmitter and a receiver, while the helpers act only as transmitters. To model this, we denote s 1 , . . . , s 6 to be the \u201csending\u201d nodes, and t 1 , t 2 and t 3 to be the receiving nodes. To model the side-information at users 1, 2 and 3, we introduce links (s i , t i ), i = 1, 2, 3, of capacity 4, which are routing the users\u2019 observations to the corresponding receiving nodes. To model the broadcast nature of each transmission, we introduce \u201cdummy\u201d nodes r 1 , . . . , r 6 , such that the capacity of the links (s i , r i ) is the same as link capacity (r i , t j ), i = j, and is equal to R ∗ i , ∀i ∈ M.\nTo solve for actual transmissions of each terminal, we apply the algebraic network coding approach [11], with appropriately designed source matrix A which corresponds to the side- information of all terminals. Finally, the network code for the data exchange problem with helpers can be constructed in polynomial time from the algorithms provided in [12] which are based on a simultaneous transfer matrix completion.\nIn this paper, we studied the data exchange problem with helpers. We provided a deterministic polynomial time algo- rithm for minimizing the weighted sum-rate cost of commu- nication. We showed that the data exchange problem with only one user and many helpers can be solved analytically\nusing Edmonds\u2019 algorithm. Further, using the single user solution as a building block we showed how one can solve the more general problem with arbitrary number of users. Several extensions are of interest. For instance, we can consider a modiﬁcation of the original data exchange problem where only helpers are allowed to transmit. Starting from a single user case, it is easy to see that an achievable rate vector must satisfy all the cut-set constraints over the helper set such that the user is always on the receiving side of the cut. Minimizing the weighted sum-rate cost over all achievable rate tuples can again be done using Edmonds\u2019 algorithm (see Algorithm 1). Finally, extension to the multiple user case corresponds to the weighted sum-rate minimization over all rate tuples that are simultaneously achievable for all the users. This optimization problem can be solved in polynomial time using the same approach as described in Section III-B."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"S. El Rouayheb"},{"name":"A. Sprintson"},{"name":"P.
