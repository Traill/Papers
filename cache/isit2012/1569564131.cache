For two-user interference channels, the capacity was found for the weak and strong interference regimes in [1] and [2], respectively. [1] showed that sum capacity is achieved by decoding desired message treating interference as noise in the weak interference condition. It was shown in [2] that jointly decoding is optimal in the strong interference condition. The Han-Kobayashi scheme [3] which is known as the rate splitting scheme is considered in the moderate interference regime the best one although the capacity achieving strategy has not found yet. Recently, Etkin, Tse and Wang proved that a simple Han-Kobayashi scheme achieves the capacity within one bit [4] and the optimal generalized degree of freedom. Compared to a two- user interference channel, interference channels with more than two users have not been much known yet despite its importance.\nIn these days, hierarchical cell architecture becomes popular due to the requirement of co-existence of heterogeneous net- works. In hierarchical cell environments, the characteristics of interference are quite different from those in conventional cell environments. According to the topology of the hierarchical cell structure, each transmitter has a disparity in available information. The upper layer cells are likely to know the data to be transmitted from the lower layer cells because data ﬂows from upper layer cells to lower layer cells through backhaul. Fig. 1 shows a two-layer cellular architecture where a mother base station (BS) knows its daughter BSs\u2019 data and operates as a cognitive transmitter.\nIf upper layer cells know the data for lower layer cells, the communications in the layered cell structure are well modeled by an interference channel with cognitive transmitters. A\ntwo-user interference channel with a cognitive transmitter is called the two-user cognitive interference channel and has been gradually studied [5]\u2013[8]. The authors of [5] analyzed the achievable rate when rate splitting [3] and Gel\u2019fand-Pinsker coding [9] are jointly used. In order to enlarge the rate region, the authors additionally analyzed the achievable rate when a cognitive transmitter does not send its own message but instead transmits the message for the other user. By time sharing, the rate region was shown to be totally achieved. The capacity of a two-user interference channel with a cognitive transmitter was found in the strong interference regime [7] and the capacity of that channel was found in the weak interference regime [6]. The authors of [7] showed that superposition coding with jointly decoding at all receivers is optimal in the strong interference condition. It is shown in [6] that Gel\u2019fand- Pinsker coding without rate splitting is capacity achievable in the weak interference condition. The capacity for other channel conditions, unfortunately, is not derived yet. In [8], an efﬁcient strategy was suggested combining rate-splitting scheme, Gel\u2019fand-Pinsker coding and superposition coding for general interference conditions.\nA three-user interference channel with a cognitive transmit- ter is not a straightforward extension of a two-user cognitive interference channel [5]\u2013[8]. A three-user interference channel has much more possible combinations of channel conditions compared to a two-user interference channel. The complicated interactions among the channels make it difﬁcult to ﬁnd the optimal transmission strategy in a three-user interference\nchannel. The three-user interference channel with a cognitive transmitter, nevertheless, has not received much attention despite its importance and there have been few studies on that channel. Recently, achievable rate regions were analyzed when a Gel\u2019fand-Pinsker coding without rate splitting is applied to the three-user IC with a cognitive transmitter in [10]. This scheme enlarges the rate region compared to a general three- user IC by interference cancelation in a cognitive receiver. However, the capacity of a three-user IC with a cognitive transmitter in any channel condition has not been known yet. One thing that is certain is the fact that the proposed scheme in [10] is not expected to achieve the capacity in a strong interference channel because it is well known that the message must be jointly decoded with interference to achieve higher rate in strong interference channels.\nIn this paper, we present the capacity region of a three- user interference channel with a cognitive transmitter. We ﬁrst classify the channel conditions according to interference chan- nel gains. Then, we identify the optimal strategies and derive the capacity regions for some channel conditions. Speciﬁcally, the capacity region when all interference gains are strong is derived. Based on the capacity results we derived, we study the capacity region in a Gaussian case.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follow. In Section II, we describe the channel model for a three-user interference channel with a cognitive transmitter and classify the channel conditions according to interference gains. The capacity when all interference gains are strong is analyzed in Section III. The capacity is also analyzed in Section IV for Gaussian channels with strong conditions. Finally, we draw conclusions in Section V.\nThe three-user interference channel with a cognitive trans- mitter is given in Fig. 2. S 3 and S k denote cognitive and non-cognitive senders, respectively, where k ∈ {1, 2}. Re- ceivers are denoted by D k where k ∈ {1, 2, 3}. Three independent messages W k ∈ {1, . . . , 2 nR k } for k ∈ {1, 2, 3} are transmitted from the senders. Then, the three- user interference channel with a cognitive transmitter is described by (X 1 , X 2 , X 3 , Y 1 , Y 2 , Y 3 , p(y 1 , y 2 , y 3 |x 1 , x 2 , x 3 )) where X 1 , X 2 , X 3 and Y 1 , Y 2 , Y 3 are input and output al- phabets, respectively. We assume a memoryless and discrete\nTransmitter S k sends its M k bit message over n channels and then receiver D k receives the message at a rate of M k /n per channel. Encoders of S k , k ∈ {1, 2}, and S 3 encode their messages W k and W 3 by encoding functions f k and f 3 into codewords X n k = f k (W k ) and X n 3 = f 3 (W 1 , W 2 , W 3 ), respectively. A decoder of D k , k ∈ {1, 2, 3}, decodes the message W k from Y k by decoding functions W k = g k (Y n k ). A rate triple (R 1 , R 2 , R 3 ) is achievable if there exist encoding functions and decoding functions such that\nThe capacity region C 3−CIC of the three-user interference channel with a cognitive transmitter is the closure of the set of all achievable rate triples. Note that if X 1 = X 1 , X 2 = ∅, and X 3 = X 2 , C 3−CIC (R 1 , R 2 , R 3 ) = C 2−CIC (R 1 , 0, R 2 )\nwhere C 2−CIC is the capacity region of the two-user cognitive interference channel.\nFor all input distributions p X 1 X 2 X 3 = p X 1 p X 2 p X 3 |X 1 X 2 , a three-user interference channel can be roughly character- ized by the three cross-channel conditions \u2013 (1) channel from the cognitive transmitter to the non-cognitive receivers {S 3 → D k , k ∈ {1, 2}}, (2) channel from the non-cognitive transmitters to the cognitive receiver {S k → D 3 , k ∈ {1, 2}}, (3) channel from a non-cognitive transmitter to the other non- cognitive receiver {S k → D l , k, l ∈ {1, 2}, k = l}.\nIn general, the cross-channel is classiﬁed into three cate- gories, weak, moderate, and strong, so three-user interference channels can be classiﬁed into 27 (= 3 3 ) cases. In this paper, we consider only a case that all cross-channels are strong.\nI(X 3 ; Y 3 |X 1 X 2 ) ≤ I(X 3 ; Y 2 |X 1 X 2 ), \t (1) I(X 3 ; Y 3 |X 1 X 2 ) ≤ I(X 3 ; Y 1 |X 1 X 2 ). \t (2)\nI(X 1 X 3 ; Y 1 |X 2 ) ≤ I(X 1 X 3 ; Y 2 |X 2 ), \t (3) I(X 2 X 3 ; Y 2 |X 1 ) ≤ I(X 2 X 3 ; Y 1 |X 1 ) \t (4)\nfor all input distributions p X 1 X 2 X 3 = p X 1 p X 2 p X 3 |X 1 X 2 . \u2022 S k → D 3 : Strong, k ∈ {1, 2} if\nI(X 1 X 3 ; Y 1 |X 2 ) ≤ I(X 1 X 3 ; Y 3 |X 2 ), \t (5) I(X 2 X 3 ; Y 2 |X 1 ) ≤ I(X 2 X 3 ; Y 3 |X 1 ), \t (6)\nI(X 1 X 2 X 3 ; Y 1 ) ≤ I(X 1 X 2 X 3 ; Y 3 ), \t (7) I(X 1 X 2 X 3 ; Y 2 ) ≤ I(X 1 X 2 X 3 ; Y 3 ) \t (8)\nIn this section, we ﬁrst consider the condition that the interference channels are all classiﬁed as strong interference channels.\nTheorem 1: For the interference channel condition which satisﬁes\nI(X 3 ; Y 3 |X 1 X 2 ) ≤ I(X 3 ; Y 2 |X 1 X 2 ), \t (9) I(X 3 ; Y 3 |X 1 X 2 ) ≤ I(X 3 ; Y 1 |X 1 X 2 ), \t (10) I(X 1 X 3 ; Y 1 |X 2 ) ≤ I(X 1 X 3 ; Y 2 |X 2 ), \t (11) I(X 1 X 3 ; Y 1 |X 2 ) ≤ I(X 1 X 3 ; Y 3 |X 2 ), \t (12) I(X 2 X 3 ; Y 2 |X 1 ) ≤ I(X 2 X 3 ; Y 1 |X 1 ), \t (13) I(X 2 X 3 ; Y 2 |X 1 ) ≤ I(X 2 X 3 ; Y 3 |X 1 ), \t (14)\nI(X 1 X 2 X 3 ; Y 1 ) ≤ I(X 1 X 2 X 3 ; Y 3 ), \t (15) I(X 1 X 2 X 3 ; Y 2 ) ≤ I(X 1 X 2 X 3 ; Y 3 ) \t (16)\nfor all input distributions p X 1 X 2 X 3 = p X 1 p X 2 p X 3 |X 1 X 2 , the capacity region of the three-user interference channel with a cognitive transmitter is determined by\nR 3 ≤ I(X 3 ; Y 3 |X 1 X 2 ), R 1 + R 3 ≤ I(X 1 X 3 ; Y 1 |X 2 ), R 2 + R 3 ≤ I(X 2 X 3 ; Y 2 |X 1 ),\nBoth achievability and converse are proved in the following subsections, respectively.\nFor the proof of achievability of Theorem 1, this subsection derives achievable rate region when the encoder 3 adopts superposition coding and all decoders jointly decode all the messages from the transmitters. The encoder of a cognitive transmitter S 3 superimposes W 3 on (X n 1 , X n 2 ), which are independently encoded in the encoder 1 and 2. The decoder D k , k ∈ {1, 2, 3}, decodes the unique W k from the received data by joint decoding.\nTheorem 2: If the cognitive transmitter adopts superposi- tion coding and all decoders jointly decode all the messages, the achievable rate region R sp is the set of all achievable rate triples such that\nR 3 ≤ I(X 3 ; Y 3 |X 1 X 2 ), (17) R 1 + R 3 ≤ I(X 1 X 3 ; Y 1 |X 2 ), (18) R 1 + R 3 ≤ I(X 1 X 3 ; Y 3 |X 2 ), (19) R 2 + R 3 ≤ I(X 2 X 3 ; Y 2 |X 1 ), (20) R 2 + R 3 ≤ I(X 2 X 3 ; Y 3 |X 1 ), (21)\nProof: Fix the distribution p(x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ) \t = p(x 1 )p(x 2 )p(x 3 |x 1 , x 2 ).\nCodebook Generation : Randomly and independently gen- erate 2 nR k , k = 1, 2, sequences x n k (w k ), w k ∈ [1 : 2 nR k ], each according to n i=1 p X k (x k,i ).

Similarly, the decoder D 2 ﬁnds the unique message ˆ w 2 such that (x n 1 (w 1 ), x n 2 ( ˆ w 2 ), x n 3 (w 1 , ˆ w 2 , w 3 ), y n 2 ) ∈ T (n) where T (n) is the -typical set.

However, we omit it due to space limitations.\nIf the cross-channel from the non-cognitive transmitter to the cognitive receiver is strong, i.e., {S k → D 3 : Strong, k ∈ {1, 2}}, the conditions (12), (14), (15) and (16) are satisﬁed and thus the achievable rate constraints (19), (21) and (24) are no more needed.\nB. An Outer Bound: {S 3 → D k : Strong, k ∈ {1, 2}} and {S k → D l : Strong, k, l ∈ {1, 2}, k = l}\nThis subsection derives an outer bound on the capacity when both cross-channels from the cognitive transmitter to the non-cognitive receivers and from the non-cognitive transmitter to the non-cognitive receiver are strong, i.e., {S 3 → D k : Strong, k ∈ {1, 2}} and {S k → D l : Strong, k, l ∈ {1, 2}, k = l}.\nTheorem 3: For the interference channel conditions {S 3 → D k : Strong k ∈ {1, 2}} and {S k → D l : Strong, k, l ∈ {1, 2}, k = l} which are equivalently given by\nI(X 3 ; Y 3 |X 1 X 2 ) ≤ I(X 3 ; Y 2 |X 1 X 2 ), I(X 3 ; Y 3 |X 1 X 2 ) ≤ I(X 3 ; Y 1 |X 1 X 2 ), I(X 1 X 3 ; Y 1 |X 2 ) ≤ I(X 1 X 3 ; Y 2 |X 2 ), I(X 2 X 3 ; Y 2 |X 1 ) ≤ I(X 2 X 3 ; Y 1 |X 1 ),\nfor all input distributions p X 1 p X 2 p X 3 |X 1 X 2 , the capacity re- gion of a three-user interference channel with a cognitive transmitter has an outer bound\nR 3 ≤ I(X 3 ; Y 3 |X 1 X 2 ), (25) R 1 + R 3 ≤ I(X 1 X 3 ; Y 1 |X 2 ), (26) R 2 + R 3 ≤ I(X 2 X 3 ; Y 2 |X 1 ), (27)\nTo prove this outer bound, we will use the following lemma. Lemma 1: If the inequalities\nI(X 3 ; Y 3 |X 1 X 2 ) ≤ I(X 3 ; Y 2 |X 1 X 2 ), I(X 3 ; Y 3 |X 1 X 2 ) ≤ I(X 3 ; Y 1 |X 1 X 2 ), I(X 1 X 3 ; Y 1 |X 2 ) ≤ I(X 1 X 3 ; Y 2 |X 2 ), I(X 2 X 3 ; Y 2 |X 1 ) ≤ I(X 2 X 3 ; Y 1 |X 1 ),\nare satisﬁed for all input distributions p X 1 p X 2 p X 3 |X 1 X 2 , then the following inequalities hold.\nProof: From [2], the condition I(X 3 ; Y 3 |X 1 X 2 ) ≤ I(X 3 ; Y 2 |X 1 X 2 ) implies I(X 3 ; Y 3 |X 1 X 2 W 1 W 2 ) \t ≤\nI(X 3 ; Y 2 |X 1 X 2 W 1 W 2 ) because of the Markov chains given by\n(W 1 , W 2 ) → (X 1 , X 2 , X 3 ) → (Y 2 , Y 3 ), X 3 → (W 1 , W 2 ) → (X 1 , X 2 ).\nis also satisﬁed by a simple extension of Lemma 5 in [7].

We derived rate regions achieved by superposition coding and joint decoding. From these rate regions and newly derived outer bounds, we concluded that the capacity region is obtained by superposition coding when all interference gains are strong. In addition, we derived the capacity region for Gaussian channels under four simple channel conditions.\nThis work was supported by the National Research Foun- dation of Korea(NRF) grant funded by the Korea govern- ment(MEST) (No. 2011-0029329)."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"V.
