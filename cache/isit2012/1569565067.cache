If the vectors a 1 = [a 11 a 12 ] T and a 2 = [a 21 a 22 ] T are linearly independent, then the receiver can solve for its desired codeword x k . This technique performs well strating in the moderate SNR regime (see Figure 1), and sufﬁces to achieve rates within a constant gap of the symmetric capacity of the symmetric K-user interference channel.\nWe consider the symmetric K-user Gaussian interference channel. This channel consists of K transmitter-receiver pairs that wish to simultaneously communicate across a shared channel over n time slots, where the channel gains are constant over all n channel uses. We assume a real-valued channel model throughout. Each transmitter has a message w k drawn independently and uniformly over {1, 2, . . . , 2 nR SYM }, and is equipped with an encoder, E k : {1, 2, . . . , 2 nR SYM } → R n , that maps its message into a length- n channel input x k = E k (w k ). The channel inputs satisfy the power constraint x k 2 ≤ nSNR, where SNR > 0 is the signal-to-noise ratio. The channel output at each receiver is a noisy linear combination of its desired signal and the sum of the interfering terms, of the form\nwhere g > 0 parametrizes the interference strength and z k is an i.i.d. Gaussian vector with mean 0 and variance 1. We deﬁne the interference-to-noise ratio to be INR g 2 SNR and the interference level to be 1\nEach receiver is equipped with a decoder, D k : R n → {1, 2, . . . , 2 nR SYM }, that produces an estimate ˆ w k = D k (y k ) of its desired message w k . A symmetric rate R SYM is achievable if, for any ǫ > 0 and n large enough, there exist encoders and decoders that can attain probability of error at most ǫ. The symmetric capacity C SYM is the supremum of all achievable symmetric rates.\n\u2022 Noisy Interference Regime, 0 ≤ α < 1 2 , 1\n\u2022 Weak Interference Regime, 1 2 ≤ α < 2 3 , 1\n\u2022 Moderately Weak Interference Regime, 2 3 ≤ α < 1, 1\n\u2022 Strong Interference Regime, 1 ≤ α < 2, 1\nfor all channel gains except for an outage set whose mea- sure is a fraction of 2 − c of the interval 1 < |g| <\n\u2022 Very Strong Interference Regime, α ≥ 2, 1\nThe outer bounds in Theorem 1 are based on the outer bounds from [10] for the two-user interference channel. These bounds for the K-user interference channel since, from the perspective of each receiver, adding more interferers cannot increase its own capacity.\nIn the noisy interference regime, the inner bound is ob- tained simply by treating interference as noise. Conversely, in the very strong interference regime, the inner bound can be obtained by decoding and removing the interference, as ﬁrst shown in [11]. Our main contributions are the inner bounds for the strong, moderately weak and weak interference regimes. These bounds rely on two different lattice-based interference alignment schemes whose achievable rates are stated in Theorems 2 and 3. Note that the rates are expressed in terms of integer least-squares optimization problems. To obtain our closed-form inner bounds in these regimes, we make use of new bounds and techniques based on compute-and-forward that are developed in [12]. Due to space limitations, proofs are omitted and the reader is referred to [13] for the full details.\nFigure 1 shows the achievable rates given by Theorems 2 and 3 for the three-user symmetric interference channel for several values of SNR. The rates plotted in the ﬁgure were found numerically by solving the corresponding integer least- squares problems. For reference, we have also plotted the upper bounds of [10] and the rate achievable by time division. In the sequel we introduce the coding schemes used for deriving Theorems 2 and 3.\nWe employ the nested lattice framework originally proposed in [14]. A lattice Λ is a discrete subgroup of R n which is closed under reﬂection and real addition. Formally, for any t 1 , t 2 ∈ Λ, we have that −t 1 , −t 2 ∈ Λ and t 1 + t 2 ∈ Λ.\nWe denote the nearest neighbor quantizer associated with the lattice Λ by Q Λ (·) and the Voronoi region by V. The modulo operation returns the quantization error w.r.t. the lattice, [x] mod Λ = x − Q Λ (x).\nA lattice Λ is said to be nested in Λ 1 if Λ ⊆ Λ 1 . Our schemes utilizes a chain of K + 1 nested lattices satisfying Λ ⊆ Λ K ⊆ · · · ⊆ Λ 1 . From these lattices, we construct K codebooks, one for each user. Speciﬁcally, user k is allocated the codebook L k = Λ θ(k) ∩ V, where V is the Voronoi region of Λ and the function θ(k) : {1, . . . , K} → {1, . . . , K} maps between users and lattices. The rate of each codebook L k is R k = 1 / n log |Λ θ(k) ∩ V|.\nThe channel (2) may describe the signal seen by a receiver in an interference network, perhaps after appropriate precoding at the transmitters. In such networks, each receiver is only interested in the messages from some of the users while the others act as interferers. Hence, it is beneﬁcial to align several interfering users into one effective interferer, by taking advantage of the fact that the sum of lattice codewords is itself a lattice codeword.\nDeﬁnition 1 (Effective users): For the MAC speciﬁed by (2), we deﬁne L effective users\nDeﬁnition 2 (Effective MAC): The K-user MAC (2) in- duces the effective L-user MAC\nwith the vector of effective channel coefﬁcients g = [g 1 · · · g L ] T ∈ R L . The effective channel is further char- acterized by the effective users\u2019 weights b 2 eff ,ℓ = m∈K ℓ b 2 m\n(g, a, B) where\nFirst scheme - A single-layer lattice code : This scheme uses a pair of nested lattices Λ ⊆ Λ 1 to construct the codebook L = Λ 1 ∩ Λ of rate R SYM . All users encode their messages using this codebook. Since all interferers arrive at the kth transmitter with the same gain, they will be aligned into one effective lattice point. Thus, the K-user MAC seen by the kth receiver becomes an effective two-user MAC of the form deﬁned in Section III-B\nwhere x eff ,k1 = x k , x eff ,k2 = m=k x m are the effective users, b 2 eff ,k1 = 1, b 2 eff ,k2 = K − 1 are the effective users\u2019 weights and g = [1 g] T is the vector of channel gains.\nThe next theorem gives an achievable rate region for the K- user interference channel when each receiver jointly decodes both the effective user x eff ,k1 which carries the desired infor- mation, and the effective user x eff ,k2 which carries the sum of interfering codewords. The theorem relies on decoding two independent linear combinations of the effective lattice points. This is in contrast to the successive decoding technique used in [11], where ﬁrst the interference is decoded and removed, and only then the desired lattice point is decoded.\nTheorem 2: Let R comp ,1 ≥ R comp ,2 be the optimal com- putation rates for the effective MAC (5) induced by the symmetric K-user interference channel (1). Any symmetric rate R SYM < R comp ,2 is achievable for the symmetric K-user interference channel (1).\nFor the two-user case, it is known that in the weak and moderately weak interference regimes each receiver should decode only part of the message transmitted by the other user [10]. A natural extension of this Han-Kobayashi [15] approach to the K-user case is for each receiver to decode linear combinations that only include parts of the interfering messages. This is enabled by using a superposition of two lattice codewords at each transmitter. See Figure 2 for an illustration.\nSecond scheme - Lattice Han-Kobayashi : This scheme em- ploys a chain of nested lattices Λ ⊆ Λ 2 ⊆ Λ 1 to construct two codebooks L 1 and L 2 with rates R 1 and R 2 , respectively. Each user k splits its message w k into two messages, a public message w k1 that is mapped into codebook L 1 and a private message w k2 that is mapped into codebook L 2 . It is convenient to treat each user k as two virtual users with codewords x k1 and x k2 that carry messages w k1 and w k2 , respectively. User k transmits a superposition of its virtual users\u2019 codewords,\ny k = 1 − γ 2 x k1 + γx k2 + g 1 − γ 2\nR HK comp ,3 be the optimal coefﬁcient vectors and computation rates for this effective MAC.
