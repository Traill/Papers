The decimation d = (2 m − 1)r + 1 is said to be of (binary) Niho type and was ﬁrstly studied by Niho in his thesis [6].

The cross correlation values, as well as their distributions, will be determined. It will be shown that all cross correlations are four valued with small maximal magnitude.\nBefore stating the main result, we introduce some notations and auxiliary tools. Let q = 2 2m with m odd and g be a primitive element of GF (q). Let 5r ≡ 1 (mod 2 m + 1) and d = (2 m − 1)r + 1. Then gcd(d, q − 1) = 3.\nFor a, b ∈ GF (q), deﬁne T (a, b) =\nwhere Tr : GF (q) → GF (2) is the trace mapping. Denote by\nLemma 1. The equation f c (u) = 0 has multiple roots if and only if c ∈ S. In this case,\nProof: Since f c (u) = 0 has multiple roots if and only if f c (u) and its derivative f \u2032 c (u) have a nontrivial greatest common divisor, then we have\nNow we state a result which can be used to reduce the number of possible values of T (a, b).\nLemma 2. (see Lemma 22, [2]) Consider the quadratic polynomial\nMoreover, if Q has three different roots, say u 0 , u 1 , u 2 ∈ GF (2 n ), then the collection of all, i.e., 2 e 0 +1 roots in GF (2 n ) can be parameterized as follows:\nwhere A 0 , A 1 , A 2 ∈ GF (2 e 0 ), (A 0 , A 1 , A 2 ) = (0, 0, 0), and A 0 + A 1 + A 2 = 0. We have\nLemma 3. For a, b ∈ GF (q) and (a, b) = (0, 0), T (a, b) takes values −1 + i · 2 m with i = −1, 0, 1, 2.\nProof: It is easy to verify that the statement is valid if ab = 0. For b = 0, by changing variable x → b − 1 x we have T (a, b) = T (c, 1) with c = ab − d . Then from Niho\u2019s observation (see Niho [6]), we have\nFirstly we will show that, for any c ∈ GF (q) ∗ , the equation (5) has at most ﬁve solutions in S. Setting x = u 5 with u ∈ S. Then we have\nwith u ∈ S. This equation has at most ﬁve solutions in S for any c ∈ GF (q) ∗ and so does (5).\nNow we will claim that it can not have exactly four distinct solutions in S. Otherwise, suppose the four distinct solutions are x i ∈ S (1 ≤ i ≤ 4). Then the ﬁfth solution x 5 = (x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 ) − 1 is also in S. But since (6) has only four distinct solutions, then (6) must have multiple roots in S. Then by Lemma 1, f c (u) = 0 has only one or two solutions in S which is a contradiction.\nSecondly, we exploit Lemma 2 to reduce the possible number of solutions of f c (u) = 0. Here we have n = 2m\nand e = e 0 = 2. Suppose u 0 , u 1 , u 2 ∈ S are three distinct solutions of f c (u) = 0. Then the other two solutions are\nwhere α is a primitive element of GF (4), i.e., 1+α +α 2 = 0. Since m is odd, we have ¯ α = α 2 . It is easy to verify\n¯ u 4 = u − 1 5 and ¯ u 5 = u − 1 4 . If f c (u) = 0 has ﬁve roots in S, then u 4 , u 5 ∈ S which implies that u 4 = ¯ u 5 − 1 = u 5 . Hence f c (u) = 0 has multiple roots. By Lemma 1, f c (u) = 0 has only one or two roots, a contradiction. Therefore f c (u) = 0 has at most three roots in S and N (c) ≤ 3.\nSummarizing, the result follows from (4). Now we need several moment identities.\nLemma 4. Let g be a primitive element of GF (q). For T (a, b) deﬁned in (2), the following identities hold: (i).\nsince both second and third inner sums are 2 2m or 0 according to x = 0 or not. Similarly,\nwhere K 3 is the number of solutions to the system of equations\nx d + y d + z d = 0. \t (7) (1). If xyz = 0, we may assume z = 0 which contributes\n2 2m solutions of (7): x = y, z = 0. In total, there are 3 · 2 2m − 2 solutions of (7) satisfying xyz = 0 (since (0, 0, 0) is triply counted).\n(2). If xyz = 0, then the number of solutions of (7) is (q − 1) · K \u2032 3\nwhere K \u2032 3 is the number of solution to x + y + 1 = 0\nBy substituting x = u 5 , y = v 5 , we derive u 5 + v 5 + 1 = 0\nTherefore, u ∈ GF (2 m ) or u ∈ GF (2 m−4 ). If u ∈ GF (2 m ), then\nwhich implies that v ∈ GF (2 m ). Similarly, u ∈ GF (2 m−4 ) implies v ∈ GF (2 m−4 ) as well.\n∗ If u, v ∈ GF (2 m ), then x, y ∈ GF (2 m ) and x d = x, y d = y. It follows that (8) has 2 m − 2 solutions satisfying xy = 0.\n∗ If u, v ∈ GF (2 m−4 ), then both x = u 5 and y = v 5 are in GF (2 m−4 ). Hence x, y ∈ GF (2 m−4 ) ∩ GF (2 2m ) ∗ = {1}. But in this case x = y = 1 is not a solutions of (8).\nRemember that m is odd and gcd(d, q − 1) = 3. Let s = {s(t) = Tr(g t )} q−2 t=0 be a sequence of period q − 1 and s \u2032 l = {s(dt + l)} q−2 t=0 be a decimated sequence of s with period (q − 1)/3 for 0 ≤ l ≤ 2. Then the cross correlation function of s and s \u2032 l by a shift τ is given by\nwhere a = g l , b = g τ . Therefore the cross correlation distribution of s and s \u2032 l can be obtained after the explicit study of T (a, b). Recall that\nwhere c = ab d and N (c) is the number of solutions of f c (u) = 0 with u ∈ S.\nDeﬁne G i to be the number of pairs (a, b) ∈ GF (q) × GF (q) with (a, b) = (0, 0) satisfying T (a, b) = −1 + (i − 1) · 2 m . Note that for any b ∈ GF (q) ∗ , T (0, b) = −1 and for a ∈ GF (q) ∗ ,\nand the equality holds if and only if the equalities in (14) hold. Proof: Note that T (a, b) = T (ab − d , 1) = (N (c) − 1) ·\n2 m − 1 where N(c) is the number of solutions of f c (u) = 0 in S with c = ab − d . By Lemma 1, if c ∈ S\\{1}, f c (u) = 0 has exactly two roots in S. Hence for any c = ab − d ∈ S\\{1}, we have T (a, b) = 2 m − 1.\na = 1, then for any c ∈ S\\{1}, there exists b ∈ GF (q) such that c = b − d if and only if c is a cubic (remember gcd(d, q − 1) = 3). There are (2 m − 2)/3 cubics c in S\\{1}. For each such c, there are three b satisfying c = b − d . Therefore, E 2 ≥ (2 m − 2)/3 · 3 = 2 m − 2.\na = g, similarly, we have F 2 ≥ 2 m + 1. In total,\nTheorem 1. If m is odd, then the value distribution of T (a, b) with (a, b) = (0, 0) can be described as follows.\n−G 0 + G 2 + 2G 3 = 2 3m − 2 m \t (16) G 0 + G 2 + 4G 3 = 2 4m − 2 2m \t (17)\nSolving the system equations consisting of (15)-(18) we obtain the value distribution of T (a, b) for (a, b) = (0, 0).\nCombing Lemma 5 and Theorem 1, we deduce the follow- ing result.\nCorollary 1. For E 2 and F 2 deﬁned in (11) and (12), E 2 = 2 m − 2, \t F 2 = 2 m + 1.\nNow we are ready to give the cross correlation distributions of s and s \u2032 l for 0 ≤ l ≤ 2.\nTheorem 2. For 0 ≤ l ≤ 2, the cross correlation distribution of s and s \u2032 l for τ ∈ [0, q − 2] is as follows. (i). If l = 0, we have\n−1 \t E 1 = 2 2m−1 − 2 m−1 + 2 −1 − 2 m \t E 0 = 1 3 (2 m + 1)(2 m − 2) −1 + 2 m \t E 2 = 2 m − 2\n−1 \t F 1 = 2 2m−1 − 2 m−1 − 1 −1 − 2 m \t F 0 = 1 3 (2 m + 1)(2 m − 2) −1 + 2 m \t F 2 = 2 m + 1\nProof: We will only prove the case l = 0. The other case is similar.\nIn this paper, the cross correlation distributions of an m- sequence s = {s(t)} of period q − 1 and its decimated sequences with short period (q − 1)/3 are determined. The cross correlations are four valued with maximal absolute value 2√q − 1.\nThe work of J.Luo is supported by Norwegian Re- search Council (No. 191104/v30), NSF of China under grant 60903036, NSF of Jiangsu Province under grant 2009182 and the research fund of National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University (No. 2010D12).
