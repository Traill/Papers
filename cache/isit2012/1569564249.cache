Each cell is initially in level 0 and can only increase its level. A t-write WOM code is a coding scheme which allows one to store t mes- sages to the WOM such that on consecutive writes every cell\u2019s level does not decrease. The sum-rate of the WOM code, which is the ratio between the total amount of information written in the t writes and the number of memory cells, is bounded by log 2 ( t + 1 ) .\nOur main contribution in this work is a construction of bi- nary three-write WOM codes with sum-rate approaching 1.885 for sufﬁciently large number of cells, while the upper bound is 2. This improves upon a recent construction of sum-rate 1.809. We also give constructions of non-binary WOM codes which give better sum-rate than the currently best known ones."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"P. Cappellett"},{"name":"C. Goll"},{"name":"P.
