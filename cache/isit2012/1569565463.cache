Quantum wiretap channel model is one of most adequate formulations of this problem. In this model, the normal sender Alice sends her message to the normal receiver Bob and keeps its secrecy for the eavesdropper Eve. The sender is assumed to be able to use an auxiliary random variable subject to the perfect uniform distribution. This assumption is usual in the quantum setting [5], [6] as well as in the classical setting[4], [2], [8], [11]. However, it is quite difﬁcult to prepare a perfect uniform random number in a realistic setting. Hence, it is required to construct a code that properly works with an auxiliary non-uniform random number. Further, it is impossible to estimate the leaked information with a ﬁnite-length code from the quantum wiretap channel capacity, which is the asymptotic limit of securely transmitted rate. Hence, from a practical viewpoint, we need to treat the decreasing speed of leaked information rather than the quantum wiretap channel capacity. For this purpose, it is usual to focus on the exponential decreasing rate (exponent) of leaked information with a given sacriﬁce information rate in information theory.\nIn fact, Devetak [5] applied the random coding to the quantum wiretap channel model. For the evaluation for leaked information, he essentially used the quantum version of the channel resolvability. The original classical version is in- vented by Han and Verd´u[12]. In the quantum version, we approximate the given output state by the output mixture state with as a small number of input states as possible. However, the quantum version of the channel resolvability treats the output approximation when the input distribution is the perfect uniform distribution. Hence, his method does not work when the perfect uniform distribution is not available.\nAfter his achievement, Hayashi[1] derived the exponent of leaked information, however, he also assume that the perfect uniform distribution is available because his method is based on the quantum version of the channel resolvability. Further, there is a possibility to improve his exponent because the commutative case of his exponent is smaller than that by Hayashi[11]. On the other hand, Hayashi and Matsumoto [13] treated secure multiplex coding in the classical setting, which requires the generalization of the channel resolvability to the case when the uniform random number is not available.\nIn this paper, we treat quantum wiretap channel model when the sender Alice cannot use the uniform random number. Alternatively, we assume that she knows the concrete form of the distribution of the auxiliary random number and the R´enyi entropy of oder 2 of the prepared auxiliary random number, which can be regarded as the sacriﬁce information rate. In the quantum wiretap channel model, two classical- quantum channels are given. One is the channel from Alice\u2019s classical information to Bob\u2019s quantum state. The other is the channel from Alice\u2019s classical information to Eve\u2019s quantum state. In this model, we focus on the code given by random coding method. Under this protocol, we give an upper bound for leaking information with the quantum mutual information criterion. This bound goes to zero exponentially when the generated key rate is less than the capacity, and can be regarded as the quantum version of Hayashi[11].\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we prepare quantum versions of information quantities. In Section III, we treat a non-uniform extension of quantum channel resolv- ability, which is a strong tool for quantum wiretap channel with an auxiliary non-uniform random number. In Section IV, we proceed to the quantum wiretap channel model and derive an exponent for leaked information, whose commutative version coincides with that by Hayashi[11]. In Section V, we give a proof for Lemma given in Section III. Due to the page limitation, we omitted several related results, which are available in the arxiv.org eprint with the same title [15].\nIn order to treat leaked information in the quantum set- ting, we prepare several information quantities in a compos- ite system H a ⊗ H E , in which, H a is a classical system spanned by the basis {|a }. When the composite state is\nρ = a P (a)|a a| ⊗ ρ a , the correlation between A and H E can be evaluated by the quantum version of the mutual information\nThen, we can deﬁne information quantities for a classical- quantum channel W : a → W a from the classical system A to the quantum system H E and a distribution p on A. Using the state ρ[W, p] := a p a |a a| ⊗ W a , we deﬁne the quantities\nIn order to treat the quantum wiretap channel model, we treat the quantum channel resolvability problem for a given classical-quantum channel W from the classical system X to the quantum system H, in which, the output quantum state W x on H is given for any element x ∈ X . In the channel resolvability, we treat the approximation of the given output state with the output average state of the auxiliary input random variable when the auxiliary input random variable is subject to the uniform distribution of the subset X 0 of the input system X of the given channel. That is, the purpose is minimizing the cardinality of the input subset X 0 when\ntribution on X 0 is not available. We assume that the auxiliary random variable is subject to a given distribution P A on the set A. Choosing a map f from A to X , we approximate a given state ρ by a∈A P A (a)W f (a) . In order to evaluate the randomness of the distribution P A , we deﬁne R´enyi entropy of order 1 + s:\nWhen we do not need to specify the random variable A, we simplify it to H 1+s (P A ).\nNow, we apply the random coding to the alphabet X with the probability distribution P X . The map Φ from A to X is randomly chosen in the following way. For each a ∈ A, Φ(a) is the random variable subject to the distribution P X on X . For a = a ∈ A, Φ(a) is independent of Φ(a ). Then, for a distribution P A on A, we can deﬁne the distribution P A ◦ Φ −1 (x) on X .\nThen, we have the following lemma: Lemma 1: For s ∈ (0, 1], we obtain\ns \t , (8) where v is the number of eigenvalues of W P X .\nNext, we consider the quantum wiretap channel model, in which the eavesdropper (wire-tapper), Eve and the authorized receiver Bob receive information from the authorized sender Alice. In this case, in order for Eve to have less information, Alice chooses a suitable encoding. This problem is formulated as follows. Let H B and H E be the quantum systems of Bob and Eve, and X be the set of alphabets sent by Alice. Then, the main quantum channel from Alice to Bob is described by W B : x → W B x , and the wire-tapper quantum channel from Alice to Eve is described by W E : x → W E x . That is, W B x (W E x ) is Bob\u2019s (Eve\u2019s) density matrix on the system H B (H E ). In this setting, Alice chooses M distributions Q 1 , . . . , Q M on X , and she generates x ∈ X subject to Q i when she wants to send the message i ∈ {1, . . . , M }. In this case, Bob (Eve) receives the density matrix W B Q i :=\n:= x Q i (x)W E x ). Bob prepares M - outcome POVM {D 1 , . . . , D M } of H B . Therefore, the triplet (M, {Q 1 , . . . , Q M }, {D 1 , . . . , D M }) is called a code, and is described by Φ. Its performance is given by the following three quantities. The ﬁrst is the size M , which is denoted by |Φ|. The second is the average error probability B (Φ):\nand the third is Eve\u2019s information regarding the transmitted message. Using the channel W E Q : i → W E Q i , we can describe this quantity by the following two ways:\nσ), the quantity I(W E |Φ) can be written by another way:\nAs another leaking information criterion, we focus on the trace norm:\nwhere W E Φ := i 1 |Φ| W E Q i . In the usual setting, the distri- bution Q i can be chosen to a uniform distribution. However, sometimes, it is difﬁcult to prepare a perfect uniform distribu- tion in a realistic setting. So, in the following, we make our code with a non-uniform distribution Q.\nNow, we make a code Φ(X) for the quantum wiretap channel based on the random coding method for given integers L and M . In the following, Alice is allowed to generate a random number on {1, . . . , L} with the distribution Q. First, we generate the random code Φ(X) with size LM , which is described by the LM independent and identical random variables X subject to the distribution p on X . That is, all of {Φ(X) l,m } are independent and obeys the distribution p on X . For integers l = 1, . . . , L and m = 1, . . . , M , As is guaranteed in the previous paper [9], we choose the decoder (POVM) D l,m (X) of the code Φ(X) such that the ensemble expectation of the average error probability concerning de- coding the input message A is less than 4(M L) s e ψ(−s|W B ,p) for 0 ≤ s ≤ 1. The proof given in [9] is valid even if the prior distribution for sent messages is not uniform. That is, when the message (l, m) is sent with the probability Q(l) M , the ensemble expectation of the average error probability concerning decoding the input message A is bounded by 4(M L) s e ψ(−s|W B ,p) for 0 ≤ s ≤ 1. Using the code Φ(X) , Alice encodes her message m = 1, . . . , M in the following way. When Alice sends her message m, she generates the random number l subject to Q, and input the alphabet Φ(X) l,m in the channel W B , W B . That is, Alice generates the alpha- bet subject to the distribution Q(X) m , which is deﬁned as Q(X) m (x) := l Q(l)δ Φ(X)\nBob recovers information l and m by using the decoder {D l,m (X)}, and discards the information l. We denote the code constructed here by Φ(X). Therefore, the above discus- sion in [9] yields that\nwhere v is the number of eigenvalues of W E p . Thus, using (9) and (12), we obtain\nFinally, we consider what code is derived from the above random coding discussion. Using the Markov inequality, we obtain\nTherefore, the existence of a good code is guaranteed in the following way. That is, we give the concrete performance of a code whose existence is shown in the above random coding method.\nTheorem 1: Assume that a random variable subject to the distribution Q on {1, . . . , L} is available. There exists a code Φ for any integer M , and any probability distribution p on X such that the code Φ only uses the distribution Q for mixing the input alphabet and\ns \t , \t (16) where v is the number of eigenvalues of W p .\nCorollary 1: Assume that a random variable subject to the distribution Q on {1, . . . , L} is available. There exists a code Φ for any integer M , and any probability distribution p on X such that the code Φ only uses the distribution Q for mixing the input alphabet and\ns \t , (18) where v is the number of eigenvalues of W p .\nProof: Now, we prove Corollary 1 using code Φ given in Theorem 1. When i is regarded as a random variable obeying the uniform distribution, Markov inequality guarantees that Tr W B Q\n(I − D i ) ≥ 3 B (Φ) holds at most probability 1/3. Similarly, D(W E Q i W E Φ ) ≥ 3I(W E |Φ) holds at most proba- bility 1/3. So, there exist at least M/3 elements i 1 , . . . , i M/3 such that Tr W B Q il (I − D i l ) ≤ 3 B (Φ), D(W E Q il W E Φ ) ≤ 3I(W E |Φ) for i = 1, . . . , M/3.\nSo, \t we \t deﬁne \t the \t code \t ˜ Φ \t := (M/3, { ˜ Q 1 , . . . , ˜ Q M/3 }, {D 1 , . . . , D M/3 }) \t with\nand ˜ D l := D i l . Then, max (W B | ˜ Φ) ≤ 3 (W B |Φ) and I(W E ˜ Q , p) ≤ \t l p l D(W E ˜ Q\nW E Φ ) ≤ 3I(W E |Φ) holds. So, we obtain the desired argument.\nIn the following, we focus on the n-fold discrete memory- less channels of the channels W B and W E , which is written as W B,(n) and W E,(n) . The n-independent and identical distribu- tion p n of p satisﬁes the additive equation ψ(s|W B,(n) , p n ) = nψ(s|W B , p). In this case, we assume that a random variable subject to the distribution Q n on {1, . . . , L n } is available. Thus, there exists a code Φ n for any integer M n , and any probability distribution p on X such that the code Φ n only uses the distribution Q n for mixing the input alphabet and\nThen, when M n L n ∼ = e nI(W B ,p) and e −sH 1+s (Q n ) ∼ = L s n ∼ = e nsI(W E ,p) , the values (19) and (20) go to zero because the number v n is bounded by (dim H E − 1) n+1 and\nthe rate max p I(W B , p) − I(W E , p) can be asymptotically attained.\nNow, we focus on the exponential decreasing rates of our upper bounds. we assume that H 2 (Q n ) ≥ nR, which implies that H 1+s (Q n ) ≥ H 2 (Q n ) ≥ nR for s ∈ [0, 1] In fact, H 2 (Q n ) can be regarded as the sacriﬁce information.\nThen, we deﬁne two kinds of the decreasing rate under the above code:\nwhere Φ(X n , p) is the ensemble of codes given in Subsection IV-A for the n-i.i.d. distribution of p. Inequality (20) yields\nIn order to show Lemma 1, we prepare two important inequalities. When we apply a quantum operation E on H E , for a given classical-quantum channel W : a → W a , we can deﬁne another channel E [W ] : a → E(W a ) from the classical system A to the quantum system H E . Then, the inequality\nhold for s ∈ (0, 1] when ρ = ρ[W, p] and W p = ρ E [1, (5.41)]. When the state σ has the spectral decomposition σ =\nwhich implies (8). In the above derivation, (24) follows from the concavity of x → log x, (25) follows from\nP A (a ) ≤ 1, (26) follows from (23), (27) follows from the following inequality, and (28) follows from (21).

Then, when the distribution of the auxiliary random variable is not the uniform distribution but is close to the uniform distribution, we have derived an upper bound for exponential decreasing rate of leaked information in the quantum mutual information criterion.\nThe author is partially supported by a MEXT Grant-in- Aid for Young Scientists (A) No. 20686026 and Grant-in- Aid for Scientiﬁc Research (A) No. 23246071.
