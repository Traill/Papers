This paper analyzes the diver- sity of the following MIMO precoders: the zero-forcing (ZF), regularized ZF, matched ﬁltering and Wiener ﬁltering. Several interesting properties of these precoders are revealed by this analysis. It is shown that regularized ZF (RZF) and the matched ﬁlter (MF) exhibit two-mode diversity: full diversity at low rates R and error ﬂoor at high rates. The rate threshold of this two- mode behavior is analytically determined. The Wiener precoder is also shown to produce a diversity that depends on the spectral efﬁciency and can be as small as one and as large as the product of the number of transmit and receive antennas."},"body":{"text":"Although many of the MIMO beneﬁts are realizable when only the receiver knows the channel, these beneﬁts can be greatly enhanced when the receiver feeds back to the transmitter [1]. In MIMO communications, knowledge of the channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) can be used in a variety of beneﬁcial ways [2], [3], [4]. Linear precoding is a simple and efﬁcient method that exploits the CSIT to match the transmission to the instantaneous channel conditions [5]. Under certain conditions, linear precoders are known to approach optimality [6], [7].\nThe classes of linear precoders include zero-forcing (ZF), regularized zero-forcing (RZF), matched ﬁltering (MF) and Wiener ﬁltering. ZF precoding and its variations use various forms of channel inversion, for example the pseudo-inverse or other generalized inverses [5].\nIn this paper, we analyze the diversity of common linear precoders. It is shown that RZF and MF precoders exhibit a two-mode diversity behavior that has not to date been precisely reported or analyzed: they either have full diversity or zero diversity (error ﬂoor) and the modes are triggered based on whether the spectral efﬁciency R is above or below a threshold that is calculated in this work.\nThe diversity of the ZF and Wiener precoding systems are also calculated. It is shown that these two precoding schemes exhibit diversity performance similar to their counterparts at the receive sides [8], [9]. More precisely the Wiener precoder produces a diversity that is a function of spectral efﬁciency as well as the number of transmit and receive antennas whereas the ZF precoder produces a diversity that is only function of the number of antennas. At very low rates, the Wiener precoder obtains a maximal diversity which is the product of the number of transmit and receive antennas, while at very high rates a minimal diversity is achieved which is the same as the ZF precoding diversity.\nWe consider a ﬂat fading channel H ∈ C N ×M , where M and N are the number of transmit and receive antennas respectively, with N M . The input-output system model is given by\nwhere T ∈ C M ×B is the precoder matrix. The number of information symbols is B min(M, N ) = N , the transmitted vector is x ∈ C B×1 , and n ∈ C N ×1 is the Gaussian noise vector. The vectors x and n are assumed independent.\nThe objective of linear precoding (possibly together with linear equalization at the receiver) is to transform the MIMO channel into min(M, N ) parallel channels that can be de- scribed by\nwhere γ k is the SINR at the k-th receiver output and we set B = min(M, N ). Let ρ be the transmitted equivalent SNR, we deﬁne the outage probability and the outage diversity as [10]\nThe outage probabilities of MIMO systems under joint spatial encoding is given by [8], [11]\nIn this paper we characterize the diversity gain, d(R, M, N ), as a function of the spectral efﬁciency R (b/s/Hz) and the number of transmit and receive antennas. This usually requires the analysis of the pairwise error probability (PEP). We shall perform outage analysis for different precoding systems as the ﬁrst step towards deriving the diversity function. The PEP analysis follows similarly to [10], [9]. This two-step approach was ﬁrst proposed in [12] due to the intractability of the direct PEP analysis for many MIMO architectures.\nWe denote the exponential equality of two functions f (ρ) and g(ρ) as f (p) . = g(p) when lim ρ→∞ log f (ρ) log(ρ) = lim ρ→∞ log g(ρ) log(ρ) . In the following, we shall need to specify various upper and lower bounds or approximations of the SINR γ, which will give rise to a number of pseudo-SINR variables ˆ γ, ˘ γ, and ¯ γ.\nThe ZF precoder completely eliminates the interference at the receiver. ZF precoding is well studied in the literature via performance measures such as throughput and fairness under a total (or per antenna) power constraint [13, and references therein]. One approach to design the ZF precoder is to solve the following optimization problem [5]\nwhere β is a scaling factor to satisfy the transmit power constraint [5]: β 2 tr TT H \t ρ. Thus the received SINR per stream is given by\nN λ min ) R . = P λ\nwhere λ k ise the k-th eigenvalue of HH H . The marginal distribution f 1 (λ) of λ min is f 1 (λ) = cλ (M −N) [14] where c is a constant, therefore the bound in (8) can be evaluated [11] yielding:\nWe now proceed with a lower bound on outage. The outage probability in (7) can be bounded as\n(HH H ) −1 kk ) R . = P \t 1\nis dis- tributed according to the chi-square distribution with 2(M − N + 1) [15]. From (9) and (10), we conclude that the bound is tight.\nRecall that the diversity is deﬁned based on the error probability. The error analysis follows similarly to [10], [9]. Due to the space limitation, we provide the pairwise error probability (PEP) analysis online [16]. We thus conclude that the diversity of MIMO system using the ZF precoding given by (5) and joint spatial encoding is d ZF P = M − N + 1.\nIn general, direct channel inversion performs poorly due to the singular value spread of the channel matrix [17]. One technique often used is to regularize the channel inversion:\nThe eigen decomposition of the Wishart channel is HH H = U Λ U H , where the matrix U ∈ C N ×N is unitary and Λ ∈ R N ×N is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are the eigenvalues of HH H . Let u k be the k-th column of U H and u kl is the (k, l) entry of the matrix U. Recall that\ny = HTx + n = βUΛ(Λ + c I) −1 U H x + n. \t (12) allowing us to decompose the received waveform at each antenna into signal, interference, and noise terms [17]:\nwhere (14) follows from the eigen decomposition of HH H . The received signal power is given by P T = E||HTx|| 2\nThe SINR is evaluated by computing the signal and inter- ference powers from (13). For a given channel H, the power of desired and interference signals at the k-th receive antenna are respectively given by\n2 ρ N\nwhere we assume the noise power is unit and η is given by (14). Deﬁning the exponential order of eigenvalues λ l = ρ −α l in a manner similar to [12],\nwhere the asymptotic equality follows because in all terms c dominates ρ −α l , a fact that also implies η . = l ρ −α l .\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator of (19) by ρ 2 , we have\nThe sum in the numerator of (20) is, in the SNR exponent, equivalent to:\nwhere we use the fact that l |u kl | 2 = 1. Similarly, for the ﬁrst term in the denominator of (20)\nIf all α ℓ > 1 then the exponents of ρ are negative and the denominator is dominated by its second term, which also dominates the numerator. If at least one of the α ℓ ≤ 1, then the maximum exponent which corresponds to α min dominates each summation. Thus we have:\n  \n \nWe now concentrate on the case where there exists at least one α ℓ ≤ 1. Let µ min min k,i\nΘ . = 1 since κ α is vanishing at high SNR, and Θ and µ min are positive. We now compute P ν = κ α and P ν = 1 , or equivalently P α k > 1 ∀k and its complement. We quote one of the results of [9].\nLemma 1: Let {λ n } denotes the eigenvalues of a Wishart matrix HH H , where H is an N ×M matrix with i.i.d Gaussian entries, and let α n = − log(λ n ) log(ρ) . If 1 α n denotes the number of α n that are greater than one, then for any integer s N we have [9, Section III-A] 1\nEvaluating (28) depends on the values of Θ which is always real and positive. If Θ < 1 then we have\nΘ = 0 as 1/µ min > 1. On the other hand if Θ > 1 then\nµ min Θ O(1) (33) . = O(1) \t (34)\nΘ is not a function of ρ because µ min is independent ρ. For the rates where Θ > 1, equation (34) implies that the outage probability in (27) is not function of ρ and thus the diversity is zero, i.e. the system will have error ﬂoor. The rates for which Θ > 1 are\nThis concludes the calculation of a lower bound on the out- age probability. A similar approach will yield a corresponding upper bound, as follows. Let µ max max k=i |u kl \u2032 u ∗ il \u2032 | 2 . A lower bound on the SINR is given as\nWe can evaluate (37) in a similar way as (28), establishing that the outage diversity d RZF out = M N if the operating spectral efﬁciency R is less than R th = N log ( N N −1 ), and d RZF out = 0 if R > R th . Due to the space limitation we provide the PEP analysis for this case online [16] where we show that the outage exponent tightly bounds the SNR exponent of the error probability. Thus we have the following theorem.\nTheorem 1: For an M ×N MIMO system that utilizes joint spatial encoding and regularized ZF precoder given by (11), the outage diversity is d RZF = M N if the operating spectral efﬁciency R is less than R th = N log ( N N −1 ), and d RZF = 0 if R > R th .\nWe now analyze the diversity for the MIMO system under TxMF. The received signal is given by\n(39) The SINR at k-th receive antenna is\n(40) Observe that (40) is the same as the SINR of the RZF precoded system given by (19). Hence the analysis in the present case follows closely that of the RZF precoding. The pairwise error probability analysis is also similar to that of the RZF precoding system. Thus we conclude that Theorem 1 applies for TxMF.\nwhere β = tr( H H H + N ρ I −2 H H H ) − 1 2 where β can be interpreted as the optimum gain for the combined precoder and channel [5]. Notice that the TxWF precoding function is similar to that of the MMSE equalizer [9]. Indeed the SINR of both systems are equivalent. This can be shown by computing the SINR of the MMSE equalizer outputs in a MIMO channel given by H T . We omit the details for brevity. Hence the diversity analysis of [9], [11] for the MIMO MMSE receiver applies for the MIMO Wiener precoding and we ahve\nThis section produces numerical results for the outage prob- abilities of ZF, regularized ZF (RZF), matched ﬁlter (MF) and Wiener precoding systems. Figure 1 shows an error ﬂoor for the regularized ZF and matched ﬁltering precoded 2×2 system at high rates. However we observe that the maximum diversity is achieved for any rate R < 2 as predicted by Theorem 1. Figure 2 shows the outage probabilities of the ZF and Wiener- ﬁlter precoded 2×2 MIMO systems. The diversities calculated from the simulations match the theoretical ones. Figure 3 shows the outage probabilities for a 3 × 3 MIMO system with Wiener precoding. The diversity for the rates R = 1.5, 4, and 5 b/s/Hz is 9, 4 and 1 respectively (cf. Eq (42)).\nLinear precoders provide a simple and efﬁcient processing, and have been shown to be optimal in some scenarios [6], [7]. This paper studies the high-SNR performance of linearly precoded MIMO systems. It is shown that the regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding with a constant regularization parameter and mathced ﬁltering (MF) precoding achieve full diversity up to a certain spectral efﬁciency, while at higher spectral efﬁciencies they produce an error ﬂoor. It is also shown that Wiener ﬁlter precoding (RZF with optimized regularization parameter) exhibits a rate-dependent behavior similarly to the linear MMSE MIMO receivers [9]. The zero- forcing pecoding diversity is also analyzed."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"M. Vu"},{"name":"A. Paulraj"}],"title":{"text":"Mimo wireless linear precoding"}},{"authors":[{"name":"E.
