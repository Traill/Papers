Since then MUBs have been used in quantum key distribution protocols [3], [21], and can be used to construct signal sets for commu- nications systems [1], [7].\nA basis for C d is orthonormal if all basis vectors are orthogonal and of unit length. Two orthonormal bases B 0 and B 1 in C d are called mutually unbiased if | φ|ψ | 2 = 1/d for all φ ∈ B 0 and ψ ∈ B 1 .\nThe maximum number of mutually unbiased bases in C d is d + 1 [26]. A set of d + 1 MUBs is called complete, it is complete sets of MUBs that are of most use in the communications applications. While constructions of complete sets of MUBs in C d are known when d is a prime power [26], it is unknown if such complete sets exist in non-prime power dimensions.\nThere has been much speculation regarding connections between MUBs and ﬁnite geometries [2], [19], [20], [25]. Most of this has focused on a connection with projective and afﬁne planes.\nThe evidence for connections between MUBs and ﬁnite geometries falls into two categories: counting arguments [19], [20], and structures which construct both MUBs and ﬁnite geometries. These structures include planar functions [12], [18], symplectic spreads [11] as well as speciﬁc afﬁne planes [8], [17].\nWe investigate higher dimensional projective geometries and show that some sets of MUBs may be regarded as subspaces. Note that in order for these higher order projective geometries to exist, a projective plane of the appropriate size must also exist. If all MUBs are subspaces of larger projective geometries, then a connection between MUBs and projective planes would be proven. Alas we do not go so far.\nIt has been shown that complete sets of MUBs are equiv- alent to orthogonal decompositions of the Lie algebra sl n (C) [4], however ﬁnding orthogonal decompositions of Lie alge- bras is as difﬁcult a task as ﬁnding sets of MUBs. Some work has been done classifying Lie Algebras using projective geometry [15], but these results have as yet not been applied to decompositions of sl n (C).\nSome sets of MUBs have been show to have an Abelian group structure [10], [13]. We go further by showing that some complete sets of MUBs may be regarded as submodules of the appropriate free module, and as subspaces of a projective geometry over that module.\nWe investigate three non-equivalent constructions of MUBs. This ﬁrst construction is based on planar functions over a ﬁnite ﬁeld. For more on planar functions see for example [5]. Let ω p = e 2iπ p .\nTheorem 1 (Planar function construction): [18, Thm 4.1] Let F q be a ﬁeld of odd characteristic p. Let Π(x) be a planar function on F q . Let V a = {v ab : b ∈ F q } be the set of vectors\nwith a, b ∈ F q . The standard basis E along with the sets V a , a ∈ F q , form a complete set of q + 1 MUBs in C q .\nThe following construction has been shown to be equivalent to the planar function construction when using Π(x) = x 2 [9]. We highlight it as the submodule and subspaces structure appear in a different way to the planar function construction.\nTheorem 2 (Alltop Construction): [1] [12, Thm 1] Let F q be a ﬁnite ﬁeld of odd characteristic p ≥ 5. Let V a = {v ab : b ∈ F q } be the set of vectors\nwith a, b ∈ F q . The standard basis E along with the sets V a , a ∈ F q , form a complete set of q + 1 MUBs in C q .\nTheorem 3: [11, 3.5(b)] Let F p n be a ﬁeld of odd char- acteristic p, with n odd. Let s and n be coprime, such that s < n/2. Let V a = {v ab : b ∈ F q } be the set of vectors\nwith a, b ∈ F q . The standard basis E along with the sets V a , a ∈ F q , form a complete set of q + 1 MUBs in C q . The next construction uses Galois rings.\nTheorem 4 (Galois ring construction): [12, Thm 3] Let GR(4, n) be Galois ring of characteristic 4 and Teichm¨uller set T n . Let i = ω 4 =\n−1. Let V a = {v ab : b ∈ T r } be the set of vectors\na, b ∈ T n . The standard basis E along with the sets V a , a ∈ T n , form a complete set of 2 n + 1 MUBs in C 2 n .\nThese are not the only known constructions of complete sets of MUBs [11], but are good starting point for an investigation.\nLet R be a ring with unity, a left R-module is an Abelian group, M , together with a product R×M → M which satisﬁes the following: for all r i , r 2 ∈ R and a i , a 2 ∈ M\n1a =a, \t (5) (r 1 r 2 )a =r 1 (r 2 a) \t (6)\n(r 1 + r 2 )a =r 1 a + r 2 a \t (7) r(a 1 + a 2 ) =ra 1 + ra 2 \t (8)\nThis is familiar as the left axioms of a vector space. All F- modules where F is a ﬁeld are vector spaces. Theorem 4 uses a ring to construct MUBs, hence we need the more general object of a module. We are only concerned with commutative rings, thus all modules in consideration are both left and right modules. An (left and right) R module is free if it is isomorphic to R d for some d.\nThe trace map, familiar from ﬁnite ﬁelds, may also be used in Galois rings [24, §14]. Properties of trace map for GR(4, n) have been well studied in a coding theory context [16].\nTheorem 5: [24, Thms 7.12, 14.34, 14.37] The trace map, tr : GR(p s , n) → GR(p s , 1) has the following properties:\n1) For all r ∈ GR(p s , 1) and x ∈ GR(p s , n), rtr(x) = tr (rx).\n2) tr(α) = 0 if an only if there exists β ∈ R such that α = β − φ(β).\nwhere φ is the generalized Frobenius automorphism. Note that GR(p 1 , n) ∼ = F p n .\nFor further on Galois rings and ﬁelds we refer the reader to [24].\nThe geometric structures we are investigating are projective geometries, P G(d − 1, q), deﬁned over a ﬁnite ﬁeld and pro- jective Hjelmslev geometries P HG(d − 1, GR(4, 1)), deﬁned over a Galois ring.\nLet M be an R module that is a submodule of R d . If R is a ﬁeld, then any submodule is a subspace of R d . If R is a Galois ring then any free submodule is a subspace of R d [14].\nDeﬁnition 6: The projective geometry constructed from F q , P G(d − 1, q) is the set of subspaces of F d q . x is a point of P G(d − 1, q) and represents all vectors ρx in F d q such that ρ ∈ F ∗ q and at least one of the entries of x is non-zero.\nDeﬁnition 7: [23] The projective Hjelmslev geometry con- structed from GR(4, 1), P HG(d − 1, GR(4, 1)) is the set of subspaces of GR(4, 1) d . x is a point of P HG(d − 1, GR(4, 1)) and represents all vectors ρx in GR(4, 1) d such that ρ is a unit of GR(4, 1) and at least one of the entries of x is a unit of GR(4, 1).\nProposal 8: Let X be a complete set of MUBs which contains the standard basis in C d . Let N be the set containing all the vectors from X, except the standard basis vectors. Let the vectors in N be of the form αω x q where α ∈ R, ω q is a q th root of unity, and x ∈ Z d q . Let represent component wise multiplication, let\nand let N = {u ˆ v ∗ : u, v ∈ N }, M = {x : αω x q ∈ N }, and M = {x − y : x, y ∈ M }. Let U ⊂ M be the set containing the vectors from M for which every entry is a non-unit, then\n2) M \\ U is the set of vectors representing a subspace of a projective geometry over Z q .\nWe show this proposal is true for each of the constructions of MUBs mentioned in section II-A. This proposal says nothing about the existence of MUBs which are not constructed from a ring. All projective geometries and projective Hjelmslev geometries of dimension greater than 2 have an algebraic structure [6, §1.4], [14]. It may be the same for complete sets of MUBs.\nMUBs for which the set of vectors forms a group under point-wise multiplication have been studied [9]. Our construc- tion is more general in that the algebraic structure is in the set of vectors generated by point-wise multiplication.\nMuch of the evidence for connections between MUBs and geometric structures stems from similarities in cardinality. We show that Proposal 8 is plausible in general by using cardinalities.\nLemma 9: Let q = p n , with p odd, each point in P G(q − 1, p) is represented by p − 1 vectors. The number of vectors\nrepresented by the points in a (2n − 1)-dimensional subspace of P G(q − 1, q), with the addition of 0 is the same as the number of vectors in a complete set of MUBs in C q minus the standard basis.\nProof: Let X be an m dimensional subspace of P G(p n − 1, p) then there are p m+1 −1 p−1 points, each of which may be represented by p − 1 different vectors. Add the vector 0. (p − 1) p m+1 −1 p−1 + 1 = p m+1 . The number of vectors in a complete set of MUBs in C q , minus the standard basis is p 2n . Thus if we require every vector in the set of MUBs to represent a point in the subspace, we need a 2n − 1 dimensional subspace of P G(p n − 1, p).\nLemma 10: Each point in P HG(2 n − 1, GR(4, 1)) is rep- resented by 2 vectors. The number of vectors represented by the points in a 2 n−1 dimensional subspace of P HG(2 n − 1, GR(4, 1)), with the addition of 2 n vectors containing no unit elements is the same as the number of vectors in a complete set of MUBs in C 2 n without the standard basis.\nProof: Let X be an m dimensional subspace of P HG(2 n − 1, GR(4, 1)) then there are 2 m points in each of 2 m+1 − 1 neighbourhoods, each of which may be represented by 2 different vectors. 2.2 m (2 m+1 − 1) = 2 2(m+1) − 2 m+1 , which, when we add 2 m vectors which are generated by non units, is the number of vectors in a complete set of MUBs in C 2 m+1 , minus the standard basis.\nWe now show that for speciﬁc families of MUBs proposal 8 is true.\nTheorem 11: Let X be the complete set of MUBs in C p n generated by the planar function construction (Thm 1). Let N ⊂ X be the set of vectors X = 1 √ d ω x p where x ∈ F p r p . Let M = {x : ω x p ∈ N }, then\nwith a, b, c, d ∈ F q . Hence (v ab ˆ v cd ) ∈ N , v 00 acts as an identity element, with v ab ˆ v ((−a)(−b) = v 00 ensuring every element has an inverse; commutativity comes from F q . Thus we have shown that N, ˆ is an Abelian group (See also [10, Lem 2.84]). To show that it is a module F p × N → N , let r ∈ F p , Let be an operation on the set N which corresponds to scalar multiplication on the set M .\nwith a, b ∈ F q . Hence for all r ∈ F p and v ab ∈ N , r v ab ∈ N . The properties of F p ensure that the module axioms are satisﬁed.\n2. Part 1. shows that M is a submodule, and thus forms a subspace of F p n p . The counting results of Lemma 10 show the size of the subspace.\nFor all a, b, c, d ∈ F q , any element in v ef ∈ N can be constructed as v ef = v ab ˆ v ∗ cd for some v ab , v cd ∈ N . Thus in the deﬁnition of Proposal 8, N = N and M = M . Hence Proposal 8 holds for planar function MUBs.\nTheorem 12: Let X be the complete set of MUBs in C p n generated by the Alltop construction (Thm 2). Let S ⊂ X be the set of vectors X = 1 √ d ω x p where x ∈ F p r p . Let T = {x : ω x p ∈ N }, S = {v ˆ u : v, u ∈ S} and T = {x + y : x, y ∈ T }, then\n2) T is a 2n − 1 dimensional subspace of P G(p n − 1, p). Proof: Let v ab , v cd be as deﬁned in equation (2). We now\nshow that S = N and T = M , with M, N from Theorem 11.\nwhich is a quadratic in x, and hence a planar function. Theorem 11 may be used.\nThis highlights that structures which are not present in sets of vectors, may be present in another way, see also [17]. We use essentially the same proof for the MUBs generated by Theorem 3.\nTheorem 13: Let X be the complete set of MUBs in C p n generated by the construction of Theorem 3. Let N ⊂ X be the set of vectors X = 1 √ d ω x p where x ∈ F p r p . Let M = {x : ω x p ∈ N } then\n2) M is a 2n − 1 dimensional subspace of P G(p n − 1, p). Proof: 1. We use the operations ˆ and as in Theorem\nwith a, b, c, d ∈ F q . Let φ(b) = b p be the Frobenius automorphism [24, §7.1], then b p s = φ p s−1 (b) and hence φ p s−1 (b − d) = φ p s−1 (b) − φ p s−1 (d). Using this fact we can rearrange equation (14)\nwith a, b ∈ F q . Showing that v ab ˆ v ∗ cd ∈ N . As with Theorem 11, we use the operation and see that N is an F p module.\nAs with Theorem 11, we ﬁnd that M = M and N = N for M, M , N, N as in Proposal 8.\nThese three structures based on ﬁnite ﬁelds all conform to the structure of Proposal 8.\nTheorem 14: Let X be the complete set of MUBs in dimension d = 2 n generated by the Galois ring construction [12]. Let N ⊂ X be the set of vectors X = 1 √ d i x where x ∈ GR(4, 1) 2 n . Let M = {x : i x ∈ N }, then\n2) M is a 2 n−1 dimensional subspace of P HG(2 n − 1, GR(4, 1)).\nProof: 1. Let α = a + 2b, and β = c + 2d where a, b, c, d ∈ T n the Teichmuller set of GR(4, n). Then equation (4) becomes\nv α ˆ v β ∈ M . v 0 is the identity, v α ˆ v −α = v 0 showing inverses, and commutativity is given by the properties of Galois rings.\nLet be the operation GR(4, 1) × N that corresponds to scalar multiplication on M .\nand hence r v α ∈ M , for all r ∈ GR(4, 1). Hence M is a submodule.\n2. Part 1. shows that M is a module. To show M is free we need that for every v such that 2v = 0, there exists u such that 2u = v. Thus we require that if α is such that\nfor all x ∈ T n , then there exists β ∈ M such that α = 2β. Reverting to the p-adic notation, let α = a+2b and β = c+2d, then 2α = 0 + 2a and 2β = 0 + 2c. Hence we need to show that if tr(2ax) = 0 for all x ∈ T n , then a = 0.\nUsing Theorem 5.2, we see that this is equivalent to showing that for all x ∈ T n , there exists γ = (e + 2f ) ∈ GR(4, n) such that\nIf a = 0, then we have solved our problem. Assume a = 0, then there exists x ∈ T n such that ax = 1. Thus we require a solution to\nThis is a monic irreducible polynomial of degree 2, and hence has possible solution only in GR(4, 2). Let h(f ) = f 2 −f +1,\nthen GR(4, 2) = Z 4 [f ]/(h(f )), and hence T 2 = {0, 1, ξ, ξ+3} where ξ is a root of h(f ). From equation (22)\nξ − ξ 2 =ξ − ξ − 3 = 1, \t (24) ξ 2 − ξ 4 =ξ 2 − ξ = 3. \t (25)\nHence if ax ∈ {ξ, ξ + 3} then equation (22) has no solution. We require that equation (22) holds for ﬁxed a and all x ∈ T n , hence we require that a = 0, which shows that M is a free submodule. And thus by construction forms a subspace of P HG(2 n − 1, GR(4, 1)). The counting results of Lemma 10 show the size of the subspace.\nNote that GR(p s , 1) ∼ = Z p s , and as with Theorem 11, M = M and N = N , thus the conditions of Proposal 8 are satisﬁed.\nWe have shown that several sets of MUBs display the algebraic structure of a module and the geometric structure of a subspace of a projective Hjelmslev geometry. There are also counting results to show that this geometric structure may be true in general. Of particular note is that these structures may not arise from the sets of vectors which deﬁne the MUBs, but from the sets of vectors derived from component wise multiplication.\nWe have not covered all possible constructions of MUBs, but have shown sufﬁcient evidence that this is a structure worthy of more thorough investigation."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"O.
