It has enabled a new framework called transmission capacity (TC) framework, which led to many new profound results in the topic of wireless networks (cf. [1], [2]). The advantage of using a spatial model to describe the node positions rather than assuming a deterministic network topol- ogy is two-fold: First, such a probabilistic approach decouples the performance analysis from the actual topology, thereby in- creasing the generality of results. Second, it provides powerful means for network optimization, especially for highly dynamic networks, where interference is (unpredictably) fast-varying.\nWith few exceptions, the node positions are mostly modeled as a stationary point process. Stationarity is a desirable prop- erty, allowing analytically tractable computations and, even more important, representing a key requirement for applying the deﬁnition of TC. Even though the stationarity assumption has not really narrowed the range of obtainable insights, it poses some shortcomings to the analysis of wireless networks: Inﬁnite networks: Stationarity implies that the network is inﬁnitely large as opposed to real deployments with a ﬁnite number of nodes.\nNo border effects: Border effects are inherently neglected in inﬁnite networks. However, border effects cause heterogeneity in the nodes\u2019 capabilities depending on their location, i.e., being dis-/connected, interference-/noise-limited, etc.\nInﬁnite interference for free-space path loss: For stationary node distributions in the plane and a path loss exponent α = 2, the interference is inﬁnite almost sure (a.s.) [1], resulting in a TC of zero. More speciﬁcally, stationary models lose their accuracy as the path loss exponent decreases due to the fact\nApplication of the TC: As already mentioned, the TC applies only to stationary networks. When the node distribution is non- stationary, this metric must be modiﬁed to take into account heterogeneous node deployments.\nIn reality, wireless ad hoc networks always exhibit a het- erogeneous node distribution. The most obvious example is perhaps when the nodes are distributed in a bounded region. In such a network, the interference situation near the center will signiﬁcantly differ from that at the border. Besides this simple example, more complex deployments are often found in practice, e.g., wireless sensor networks created by airdrop [3], spontaneous formation of hot spots [4], etc.\nWe extend the existing framework by relaxing the require- ments on the node distribution, thereby allowing for isotropy only . More speciﬁcally, we have the following results:\n\u2022 The interference and outage statistics for slotted Aloha with α = 2 and α = 4 are derived as a function of the receiver position and the spatial shape of the node distribution. We consider a path loss plus block fading model. As for the outage statistics, we focus on Rayleigh fading. We show how known results for the stationary case arise from our results as special cases.\n\u2022 Two global metrics, namely the differential TC and the average sum throughput, that take into account heteroge- neous node deployments are proposed. While the former metric is a reﬁnement of the TC, the latter quantiﬁes the ﬁrst order overall network efﬁciency.\nStationary models with heterogeneous node deployment have already been investigated. Speciﬁcally, Poisson-Cluster [5] and Mat´ern hard-core models [6] have been studied, as they are well-suited for analyzing more sophisticated medium access control (MAC) schemes. Treated as general motion- invariant , these and similar models were further analyzed in [2], [7], [8] in a unifying way. In [9], a non-stationary and isotropic node distribution was assumed for analyzing multi- antenna receivers. While the analysis showed that the shape of the spatial distribution has a considerable impact on link performance, the scenario was limited only to the case of the receiver located in the origin.\nWe consider a wireless ad hoc network with nodes isotrop- ically distributed in R 2 . The MAC employed by the nodes is slotted Aloha. In a randomly chosen slot, some nodes wish to transmit a packet. We assume that the set of transmitters {x} follows an isotropic Poisson point process (PPP) Φ t := {x} on R 2 with intensity λ(x), where x ∈ R 2 . Due to the isotropy of Φ t , λ(x) is rotation-invariant and depends only on the Euclidean norm x , i.e., λ(x) = λ( x e jφ ) = λ( x ), φ ∈ [0, 2π). When working with polar coordinates, we will use the notation λ(r), where r := x . With [6], we can describe λ(r) as the resulting intensity after distance- dependent thinning of a stationary PPP of intensity λ, i.e.,\nλ(r) := λF (r), \t (1) where F (r) is called the shape function as it reﬂects the spatial shape of Φ t . We will pose the following restrictions on F (r):\n(i) Positiveness: F (r) ≥ 0 for all r ≥ 0. (ii) Normalization: max r {F (r)} = 1.\nThe restrictions (i) and (ii) are necessary to ensure that λ(r) is non-negative and bounded by λ everywhere.\nWe assume that each transmitter x has an intended receiver y randomly located at ﬁxed distance d. From the random translation Theorem [6] it follows that the set of receivers {y} forms an isotropic PPP Φ r := {y} on R 2 with intensity λ(x) as well. The ﬁxed distance assumption is commonly accepted, see [1]. However, we will relax this assumption in Section V.\nWe consider a path loss plus block fading channel with inde- pendent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) fading coefﬁcients. The power path loss between two positions x, y ∈ R 2 is given by ℓ( x − y ) := (c + x − y α ) −1 with path loss exponent α. The parameter c > 0 ensures boundedness of ℓ. The power fading coefﬁcient between a transmitter at x and a receiver at y is given by g xy , where E [g xy ] = 1 for all x, y ∈ R 2 .\nWe further place a receiver at y 0 ∈ R 2 and an intended transmitter at an arbitrary position x 0 ∈ R 2 with distance d to y 0 . The pair x 0 → y 0 is called the reference pair as it will allow us to measure the (spatially-averaged) link performance for receivers at distance y 0 from the origin.\nAssuming ﬁxed power transmissions for all nodes, the instantaneous signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the reference receiver y 0 is given by:\nwhere η is the average noise-to-signal ratio and I (y 0 ) :=\nis the interference power. We assume strong channel coding, i.e., the outage event is a steep function of the SINR. The outage probability (OP) at the reference pair x 0 → y 0 is then given by the reduced Palm probability\nWe now study the interference statistics at the reference receiver at y 0 . Before, we note the following two integral identities which are taken from [10]:\nIdentity 2. Let a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ∈ R, R := a 1 + a 2 t 2 + a 3 t 4 , ∆ = 4a 1 a 3 − a 2 2 and a 3 > 0. Using substitution t → t 2 , we have\n   \n  \nWe are now in the position to derive the ﬁrst moment of the interference at y 0 .\nTheorem 1. Let f (r) := dF (r)/dr, c > 0 and α = 2. If lim r →∞ F (r)r ν < ∞ for some ν > 0, then\nwhat follows from Campbell\u2019s Theorem and Slivnyak\u2019s The- orem [11], and from the i.i.d. property of g xy 0 . Applying Identity 1 and 2 yields the result.\nThe function A 2 (y 0 , c) in (8) has an interesting interpreta- tion: A 2 (y 0 , c) can be described as the interference ﬁeld asso- ciated with the origin o, from which the remaining interference adds up differentially.\n1) When we assume F (0) = 1 and f (r) ≤ 0 for all r ∈ R + , F (r) can be interpreted as a complementary cumulative distribution function (CDF) with respect to a random distance r to the origin, yielding\n3) Letting c → 0, we have E [I(y 0 )] = ∞, which is due to the resulting singularity of ℓ( x − y 0 ) at x = y 0 , cf. [2].\n5) Dense network ( 0 < lim r →∞ F (r)r ν < ∞, ν → 0): As expected [2], E !x 0 [I(y 0 )] = ∞.\n1) has an interesting interpretation as well: The expectation can be seen as averaging the differential interference over r. Such an interpretation may be appropriate when analyzing networks with a priori unknown or fast-varying spatial conﬁg- urations, for which a CDF is then used to model their spatial shape. 4) implies I (y 0 ) < ∞ a.s. although inﬁnitely many nodes contribute to the interference on average. Note that 5) includes the homogeneous case with F (r) = 1 (f (r) = 0).\nWe now extend the ﬁndings of Theorem 1. Before, we need the following Lemma.\n1 − |κ(t, a 1 , a 2 )| 2 , \t (9) where\nProof: The basic idea is to decompose the integrand into partial fractions and to apply Identity 1 and 2, yielding (9) after some algebraic manipulations. Note that according to [10], (5) and (6) hold only for real-valued parameters. However, they were veriﬁed to hold also for complex-valued parameters.\nProof: The proof is analogous to the proof of Theorem 1 and uses the integral identity of Lemma 1. We further make use of (ii) in Section II to show that lim r →∞ F (r) < ∞.\n1) Case c → 0: By taking the limit lim c →0 A 4 (y 0 , c) in (12), we observe that E !x 0 [I(y 0 )] = ∞, cf. 3) in Corollary 2.\nAll results of this Corollary are consistent with the literature. The ﬁrst moment of the interference is useful for bounding\nIn case of Rayleigh fading channels, the Laplace transform of I (y 0 ), i.e., L I (y 0 ) (s) := E [exp{−sI(y 0 )}], is of signiﬁcant importance, since it allows one to obtain the OP in closed- form. When treating the case α = 2, we will always assume that F (r) satisﬁes the additional condition of Theorem 1.\nTheorem 3. For g xy ∼ Exp(1) for all x, y ∈ R 2 (Rayleigh fading), the Laplace transform of I (y 0 ) at y 0 ∈ R 2 is\nfor the cases α = 2 and α = 4, where A 2 (y 0 , c) is given by (8) and A 4 (y 0 , c) is given by (12).\nwhere (a) follows from algebraic manipulations and the i.i.d. property of the g xy 0 . (b) follows from the probability generat- ing functional and the Laplace functional of a PPP [6]. After noting that L g (s) = (1 + s) −1 for g ∼ Exp(1), the integral is computed using Identity 1 and 2, and Lemma 1.\nNote that (a) in the proof holds for general point processes and some approximation techniques for computing the right- hand side already exist [12]. The (b) part is for PPPs only.\nCorollary 3. Setting F (r) = 1 for all r ∈ R + and c = 0, we obtain the well-known result for the homogeneous case with α = 4 [2]: L I (y 0 ) (s) = exp{−λ π 2 2 √ s}.\nWe now study the OP for the reference pair x 0 → y 0 . In order to broadly discuss the impact of the spatial shape on the performance, we focus on the Rayleigh fading scenario. For other channel models, the interference moments derived in Section III can be used to effectively bound the OP, e.g., using the Markov inequality [1]. We do not expect additional insights by considering also other channel models.\nTheorem 4. The OP for the Rayleigh fading scenario and α = 2 respectively α = 4 is given by\nProof: It is well-known that the OP for Aloha MAC and exponentially distributed power gains g xy can be written in terms of the Laplace transform of the interference [2], [6]: We condition (2) on Φ and evaluate the OP ﬁrst with respect to g x 0 y 0 . We ﬁnally use (13) with s = β(c + d α ).\nBy means of (14) in Theorem 4 we can now measure the OP for Rayleigh fading at an arbitrary location for an arbitrary\nspatial shape function F (r) satisfying the given restrictions. Fig. 1 shows q( y 0 ) vs. y 0 for α = 2 and α = 4, thereby conﬁrming the analysis. It can further be observed how the network \u201cmoves\u201d from the interference-limited to the power- limited regime with increasing y 0 .\nTo highlight the accuracy of the model, we compare the OP from Theorem 4 to a straightforward way of approximating the OP which consists of assuming that the intensity λ(x) is approximately constant around y 0 . In this case the OP can then be described as in the homogeneous case [2], except for the intensity in the exponential term being modulated by F (y 0 ), i.e., ˜ q(y 0 ) := 1 − exp{−F (y 0 )λπ 2 d 2 β 2 α 2 α csc 2π α } ≈ q(y 0 ). We will now study the logarithmic ratio of exact to approxi- mate success probability, i.e., γ := log 1−q(y 0 ) 1−˜ q (y\nFig. 2 shows the ratio γ together with the shape function F (r) for different receiver positions y 0 . F (r) was chosen such that the network exhibits a communication hotspot, with the density of active nodes slowly decaying between 70 and 500 until it becomes approximately zero. One can see that the approximation is not satisfactory, especially in the transition region, where border effects come into play.\nWe now propose two local throughout metrics that are suitable for non-stationary wireless ad hoc networks.\nDeﬁnition 1 (Differential transmission capacity (DTC)). The DTC is deﬁned as the maximal density of concurrent trans- missions in an inﬁnitesimal region around the point x ∈ R 2 subject to an OP constraint ǫ, i.e.,\nThe TC and its differential counterpart have similar mean- ing, except that the latter is position-dependent: For a given spatial shape F (r) and target OP ǫ, c(x, ǫ) yields the TC in a region dx. Hence, the DTC implicitly takes into account the spatial shape of the node distribution. For Rayleigh fading, c(x, ǫ) is obtained by solving (14) for λ. Like the TC, the DTC can be used for comparing different transmission protocols.\nDeﬁnition 2 (Average sum throughput (AST)). The AST is deﬁned as the ratio of average number of successful transmis- sions to average number of simultaneous transmissions, i.e.,\nThe AST quantiﬁes the ﬁrst order overall efﬁciency of the network on the MAC layer. While the DTC highlights the spatial dynamics of the local throughput, the AST yields a single ﬁgure of merit. In essence, the AST counts the num- ber of successful transmissions, thereby integrating over the spatial dynamics. Note that the success function 1 {x successful} ,\nindicating that transmitter x has been successful, can be chosen arbitrarily to include additional outage-inducing effects, e.g., energy-limitations, dis-connectivity or secrecy outage.\nTheorem 5. Let lim r →∞ F (r)r ν < ∞ for some ν > 2. With the underlying network model and success function 1 {SINR(y)≥β} , the AST Ω can be computed as\nrF (r) dr \t . \t (18) Proof: Since the denominator directly follows from\n(a) is due to Campbell\u2019s Theorem [11]. (b) is obtained by noting that a transmitter x is successful if the intended receiver at y is not in outage. From Section II, we know that y is placed by random translation of x according to some probability\nkernel P (y = y |x). (c) follows from Tonelli\u2019s Theorem [13] and (d) follows from E 1 {X∈A} = P (X ∈ A). (e) follows from (14) and the fact that q(y) is independent of x.\nBesides slotted Aloha, other MAC protocols such as CSMA/CA or local FDMA, are promising techniques for reducing excessive interference generated by nodes within shot-range . To study ad hoc networks with such inhibition mechanisms while ensuring analytical tractability, powerful methods based on non-homogeneous Poisson approximation have been used [6], [14], [15]. When such protocols are transmitter-initiated , e.g., transmitter sensing for CSMA or transmitter orthogonalization for FDMA, the resulting spa- tial distribution of interferers becomes inhomogeneous and approximately isotropic around the transmitter x, while the interference ﬁeld at the intended receiver y will depend on the distance x − y . Hence, our model can be applied also to such modeling problems and is not limited to Aloha MAC.\nConsider the following situation: Let the set {y} of potential receivers be distributed as an isotropic PPP Φ r of intensity λ r (r) = λ r F (r). Assume that Φ t and Φ r are independent. That is, the set of all nodes follows a PPP, e.g., a sensor network created by airdrop, and connectivity at distance d is no longer guaranteed for every node. We further assume that the routing protocol employs a nearest neighbor strategy, i.e., transmitters aim at minimizing d. For points distributed as a PPP, the CDF F d (d) of the distance d between a point and its nearest neigh- bor is well-known, see [6]. We would like to know the optimal SINR threshold β such that the product log 2 (1 + β) Ω(β) with success function 1 {x successful} 1 {x connected} is maximized. This corresponds to maximizing the expected sum rate, i.e.,\nwhere we altered the notation Ω → Ω(β) and q(r) → q(r, β, d) to point out the functional dependencies. (a) follows from\nWe extended prior work on the modeling and analysis of wireless networks by assuming an isotropic but not necessarily stationary spatial distribution of nodes. We derived, for slotted Aloha, the interference and outage statistics as a function of the receiver position and the shape of the spatial node\ndistribution. The case α = 2, which could not be studied yet due to the stationarity assumption, was intensively studied. For α = 4, we also obtain closed-form results, from which known results arise as special cases. We proposed two metrics for measuring local throughput in non-stationary and ﬁnite networks and discussed possible applications of our model.\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge that their work is partially supported within the priority program 1397 \u201dCOIN\u201d under grant No. JO 258/21-1 by the German Research Foun- dation (DFG)."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"S.
