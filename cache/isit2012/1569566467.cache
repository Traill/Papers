Since then, a huge body of work has been devoted to studying this problem for different network models by deriving fun- damental transmission rate limits [2], [3] and designing low- complexity schemes to approach these limits in practice [4].\nRecently a lot of efforts in information theoretic security are made to address the problem that an eavesdropper is a passive entity and hence its location or channel states can not be accurately obtained by the legitimate parties. Several different channel models have been proposed with the aim to increase the robustness of a secrecy scheme when the eavesdropper channel states are only known by distribution [5], [6], or only available with delays [7], or only known to take values in a ﬁnite set [8], [9].\nAs a more pessimistic but stronger assumption, references [10], [11] study secrecy capacity when the eavesdropper channel is arbitrarily varying and its channel states are known to the eavesdropper only. Reference [11] studies the single-user Gaussian multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) wire- tap channel and characterizes the so-called secrecy degrees of freedom (s.d.o.f.), which is the pre-log of the secrecy capacity at high SNR. The s.d.o.f. region of two user Gaussian MIMO broadcast channel with an arbitrarily varying eavesdropper channel was found in [12]. The s.d.o.f. region for two user Gaussian MIMO multiple access channel and Gaussian two- way channel with the eavesdropper channel being arbitrarily\nvarying were given in [13] and [14] respectively. These works introduced several new techniques to prove converse and achievability which were not present in the study of secure MIMO communication with known eavesdropper channel states.\nIn this work, we continue this line of work by studying the two-user MIMO interference channel with an external eavesdropper. Previously this channel model was only studied with the eavesdropper channel state perfectly known to all nodes and its s.d.o.f. region is still open [15], [16]. Here we study the channel model where the eavesdropper channel state is arbitrarily varying and known to the eavesdropper only. We focus on the case where the ranks of channel matrices between legitimate nodes do not exceed 2 while the eavesdropper has 1 antenna. For a nontrivial class of these channels models, we ﬁnd its s.d.o.f. region which is achieved by allowing only one user to transmit at a time. We also provide a non-trivial example for which we show such a transmission strategy is suboptimal. The achievability proof for this example introduces a new technique to achieve secrecy in MIMO wiretap channels. The technique leverages the fact that the eavesdropper can not obtain arbitrary linear combinations of the signals transmitted over multiple channel uses due to it having only one antenna. Hence the transmitter and receiver can use linear precoding such that effectively the information-carrying signals are beam-formed toward a direction which can not be attained by the eavesdropper and at the same time is orthogonal to the interference from the other transmitter. The transmitter injects noise to jam the eavesdropper [17] but precodes its jamming signals so that they align with the interference at the intended receiver. This enables the receiver to nullify both interference and jamming signals and achieve secrecy.\nThe Gaussian two-user MIMO interference channel with an arbitrarily varying eavesdropper channel is shown in Figure 1. The transmitter t, t = 1, 2 has N T,t antennas and receiver t has N R,t antennas and the eavesdropper has N E = 1 antennas. During the ith channel use, the channel is:\nwhere Y t (i), t = 1, 2 denote the signals received at the legitimate receiver t, and ˜ Y (i) denotes the received signal at the eavesdropper. H k,t , k = 1, 2, t = 1, 2 and ˜ H k (i), k = 1, 2 are the channel matrices. Z t , t = 1, 2 is the additive Gaussian noise observed by the intended receiver t, which is composed of independent rotationally invariant complex Gaussian ran- dom variables with unit variance. ˜ H k (i), k = 1, 2 is unknown to the legitimate parties. H k,t , t = 1, 2 are known by both the legitimate parties and the eavesdropper(s).\nTransmitter t sends a message W t to receiver t over n channel uses. W 1 , W 2 must be kept conﬁdential from the eavesdropper, but are not necessarily kept secret from the legitimate receivers.\n1 n\nFor clarity, we shall use γ to represent a sequence of { ˜ H k (i), k = 1, 2} and use { ˜ Y γ (i)} to represent the outputs of the eavesdropper channel that corresponds to this sequence of eavesdropper channel states.\nWe assume the eavesdropper channel state information sequence { ˜ H (i)} is independent from {X t (i), t = 1, 2}. In this case, as shown in [11], the secrecy constraint can be deﬁned as:\nWe require the limit in (4) to be uniform over all possible sequences of eavesdropper channel states [11].\nThe secrecy rate for the message W t , R s,t , is deﬁned as R s,t = lim n→∞ 1 n H(W t ), t = 1, 2 such that W t can be reliably decoded by receiver t and (4) is satisﬁed.\nIn this paper, we use the secrecy degrees of freedom (s.d.o.f.) region as a characterization of the high SNR be- havior of the secrecy capacity for this channel. The s.d.o.f. region is deﬁned as:\nWe use the notation A n×m to denote a matrix A with m columns and n rows and use r(A) to denote its rank. For two matrices A and B with the same number of rows, deﬁne r(A ∧ B) as\nFor two matrices A and B with the same number of columns, deﬁne r(A ∨ B) as\n{d t ≥ 0, t = 1, 2, d 1 + d 2 ≤ 1} , \t (8) {0 ≤ d t ≤ 1, t = 1, 2} . \t (9)\nTheorem 1: Let N E = 1, r(H 1,1 ) = r(H 2,2 ) = 2, then the s.d.o.f. region is given by (8) if the following conditions hold:\nWe next describe a non-trivial example, in the sense that it is not known whether the region (9) is achievable for this model. However the next theorem shows its s.d.o.f. region is strictly greater than (8).\nTheorem 2: Consider the single sided interference channel shown in Figure 2, where\nFor this channel model, any s.d.o.f. pair d 1 , d 2 = 1 is achievable if 0 ≤ d 1 < 1/3.\nWe ﬁrst need to transform the channel model so that it is easier to analyze. In particular, it is desirable to decompose at least three MIMO links of the interference channels, i.e., two intended links, and one interfering link, into parallel sub- channels. The following lemma describes a special case for which this is possible.\nthe channel can be transformed into the following form while retaining the s.d.o.f. region: Receiver 1 observes a multiple access channel composed of parallel links:\nwhere |A| + |B| = r(H 1,1 ), |B| + |C| = r(H 2,1 ), |B| = r(H 1,1 ∧ H 2,1 ). The noise random variables across the sub-channels {z i } i∈A∪B∪C are independent and each is distributed according to CN (0, 1). {x 1i } i∈A∪B denote the transmit symbols of user 1 and {x 2i } i∈B∪C denote (a subset of) the transmit symbols of user 2.\nwhere X \u2032 2 is the transmitted signals of user 2, which is a r(H 2,2 ) × 1 vector whose ﬁrst r(H 2,1 ) components are\nProof Outline: We ﬁrst apply Generalized Singular Value Decomposition (GSVD) to [H 1,1 , H 2,1 ]. It can be shown that it is possible to transform the channel observed by receiver 1 into the form (15)-(17) without affecting the s.d.o.f. region of the channel [13]. After this transformation, we can represent H 2,1 as follows:\nNote that the transformation will affect all channel matrices of legitimate links due to changes in the representation of transmitted signals. During the transformation we either multiply H i,j with nonsingular matrices or removing all zero rows from H 2,1 (which only affects the receiver). Hence it does not change r(H 2,1 ) or r(H 2,1 ∨ H 2,2 ).\nIn order to satisfy (20) for (19), the number of nonzero columns of H 2,2 (after applying the GSVD step above) cannot exceed r(H 2,2 ). Without loss of generality, we assume the last N T, 2 − r(H 2,2 ) columns of H 2,2 are zeros. We next apply singular value decomposition to the remaining r(H 2,2 ) columns of H 2,2 , denoted by H \u2032 2,2 which leads to:\nwhere U, V are unitary matrices and D is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are the singular values of H \u2032 2,2 . The channel observed by receiver 2 can then be written as following after canceling U:\nDV is an invertible matrix, which can be canceled from (22) without affecting s.d.o.f. region. Hence we obtain (18).\nWe next prove Theorem 1 in two cases. In both cases the achievability followed directly from letting only one user transmit at a time. Hence we only need to prove converse.\nDue to Lemma 1, the channel after applying transformation can be represented by Figure 3. We use Y o to represent the N R, 2 − r(H 2,2 ) components in the signals observed by receiver 2 which does not depend on signals transmitted by user 2. X o represents the signals transmitted by user 1 which can not be observed by receiver 1. Y \u2032 k , k = 3, 4 represents the components in Y k that only depends on the signals transmitted by user 1.\nSince r (H 1,1 ∧ H 2,1 ) = 1, we have r(H 2,1 ) ≥ 1. On the other hand, there is no need to consider the case r(H 2,1 ) = 1 separately, which corresponds to removing y 3 in Figure 3. This is because when proving converse for this case, we can always reveal y 3 to receiver 1 as genie information and apply the converse described in this section.\nLet {δ n } denote the non-negative sequence that goes to 0 when n goes to inﬁnity. First assume the eavesdropper mon- itors X n 1 , then from Fano\u2019s inequality and the conﬁdentiality requirement on W 1 , we have\nn (R 1 − δ n ) \t (23) ≤I(W 1 ; Y n 1 , Y n 2 , Y n 3 ) − I(W 1 ; X n 1 ) \t (24) ≤I (W 1 ; Y n 1 , Y n 2 , Y n 3 |X n 1 ) \t (25) =I (W 1 ; X n 2 + X n 3 + Z n 2 |X n 1 , Y n 3 ) \t (26)\n≤I (X n 1 , X n 2 , X n o ; X n 2 + X n 3 + Z n 2 |X n 1 , Y n 3 ) \t (27) =h (X n 2 + X n 3 + Z n 2 |X n 1 , Y n 3 )\n− h (X n 3 + Z n 2 |X n 4 + Z n 3 , X n 1 , X n 2 , X n o ) \t (28) =h (X n 2 + X n 3 + Z n 2 |X n 1 , Y n 3 )\nNext we assume the eavesdropper monitors Y n 5 . Then we have:\nn (R 2 − δ n ) \t (30) ≤I(W 2 ; Y n 4 , Y n 5 , Y n o ) − I(W 2 ; Y n 5 ) \t (31) ≤I (W 2 ; Y n 4 , Y n o |Y n 5 ) \t (32)\n≤I (W 2 ; Y n 4 , Y n o , X n 1 , X n 2 |Y n 5 ) \t (33) =I (W 2 ; Y n 4 |Y n 5 )\n+ I (W 2 ; Y n o , X n 1 , X n 2 |Y n 4 , Y n 5 ) \t (34) =I (W 2 ; Y n 4 |Y n 5 ) \t (35) ≤I (X n 3 , X n 4 ; Y n 4 |Y n 5 ) \t (36)\nn (R 1 + R 2 − δ n ) \t (39) ≤ h (X n 2 + X n 3 + Z n 2 |X n 1 , Y n 3 ) − h (Z n 4 ) . (40)\nSince the pre-log of h (X n 2 + X n 3 + Z n 2 |X n 1 , Y n 3 ) can not exceed one, we ﬁnd that d 1 + d 2 ≤ 1.\nThe channel after applying transformation can be repre- sented by Figure 4. Assume the eavesdropper monitors X n 2 , we have\nn(R 1 − δ n ) \t (41) ≤I (W 1 ; Y n 1 , Y n 2 |X n 2 ) \t (42) =I (W 1 ; X n 1 + X n 3 + Z n 1 |X n 4 + Z n 2 , X n 2 ) \t (43)\n≤I (X n 1 , X n o ; X n 1 + X n 3 + Z n 1 |X n 4 + Z n 2 , X n 2 ) \t (44) =h (X n 1 + X n 3 + Z n 1 |X n 4 + Z n 2 , X n 2 )\nThe upper bound on R 2 is the same as (37). Hence, adding (45) to (37) and applying (38), we get\nn (R 1 + R 2 − 2δ n ) \t (46) ≤ h (X n 1 + X n 3 + Z n 1 |X n 4 + Z n 2 , X n 2 ) − h (Z n 4 ) . (47)\nSince the pre-log of h (X n 2 + X n 3 + Z n 2 |X n 1 , Y n 3 ) can not exceed one, we ﬁnd that d 1 + d 2 ≤ 1.\nIn the channel model in Figure 2, the signals received by the eavesdropper Y e can be represented by two parts:\nY e 1,i = a i X 1,i + b i X 2,i , \t (49) Y e 2,i = c i X 3,i + d i X 4,i + e i X 5,i , \t (50)\nwhere a i , b i , c i , d i , e i is the channel gain observed by the eavesdropper at the ith channel use. Then for any given sequence of {a i , b i , c i , d i , e i , i = 1, ..., n}, we have the following lemma [13]:\nWe next describes an achievable scheme such that (51) and (52) are satisﬁed.\nLet X j,i denote the value of X j during the ith channel uses. For a large positive integer M , transmitter 1 computes\nX 3,i = 0, i mod M = 0 or M − 1, \t (53) X 3,i = −X 4,i−1 , i mod M = 1, ..., M − 2. \t (54)\nFor i such that i mod M = 1, ..., M − 2, Receiver 1 can compute the quantity Y i deﬁned as\nY i =Y 1,i + Y 2,i−1 \t (55) =X 1,i + X 2,i−1 + Z 1,i + Z 2,i−1 . \t (56)\nFor these channel indices {i}, transmitter 1 performs linear precoding over every three channel uses. This means, for i such that i mod M = 1, ..., M − 2 and i + 1 mod 3 = 2, Transmitter 1 computes the transmitted signals as:\nwhere J i is Gaussian jamming noise injected by transmitter 1, and U i,j is the effective input from user 1. By substituting (57)-(59) into (56), we observe that receiver 1 gets\nU 1,i + J i , \t (62) a i− 1 (U 1,i−1 + J i− 1 ) + b i− 1 (U 2,i−1 − J i ) , (63) U 2,i−2 − J i− 1 . \t (64)\nThe channel gains a i , b i , a i− 2 , b i− 2 do not appear in these signals because X 2,i = 0 and X 1,i−2 = 0. Equivalently, since the eavesdropper knows its channel states {a i , b i }, we\ncan represent the signals it received as following without any loss of information:\nFinally, let U 2,i−1 = U 1,i and U 2,i−2 = U 1,i−1 . The signals observed by receiver 1 becomes\nFor every three channel uses, the intended receiver obtains two clear signals (68)-(69), while Eve gets one overlap- ping copy of signals (71) and two heavily jammed signals (70). For this equivalent wiretap channel whose inputs are [U 1,i , U 1,i−1 ], it can be shown by following [11] that a se- crecy degree of freedom of 1 is achievable using a randomly generated Gaussian codebook and random binning scheme such that (68) is satisﬁed. By choosing a sufﬁciently large M , this means d 1 can be made arbitrarily close to 1/3 in the original channel.\nFor transmitter 2, we view every M channel uses as a single channel use. The effective channel inputs is a 2M × 1 complex vector X M,k , k ≥ 0 given by\nDue to the restriction placed on (53), the equivalent eaves- dropper channel is memoryless whose output is a M × 1 vector. The channel matrix is given by:\n  \n−c i 0 d i e i ...\n  \nwhere the subscript of the tth row equals M k+t. The channel is therefore a single-user MIMO-wiretap channel, in which the transmitter and the receiver has 2M antennas, and the eavesdropper has M antennas. In [11], it was shown that there exists a codebook that achieves an s.d.o.f. of M for this channel which satisﬁes (52). This translates to an s.d.o.f. of d 2 = 1 for the original channel.\nIn this work, we studied the Gaussian two-user interference channel with an external eavesdropper, where the eavesdrop- per channel is arbitrarily varying and its state is known to the eavesdropper only. We focused on the case where all channel matrices between legitimate transmitter and receiver\nhad rank less than or equal to 2 and the eavesdropper had 1 antenna. The s.d.o.f. region for a class of this type of channel models was found, which was achieved by allowing only one user to transmit at a time. We also provided a non- trivial example for which we proved such a transmission strategy was sub-optimal. The achievability proof for this example introduced a new method in which the artiﬁcial noise injected by the transmitter is aligned with interference at its intended receiver through linear precoding. This enables the transmitter to effectively jams the eavesdropper while the receiver can nullify the interference and jamming signals at the same time and achieves secrecy."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"C.
