An (n, M, d) R,δ code is a (not necessarily linear) subset of R n having cardinality M and minimum distance d with respect to the metric δ. Deﬁne A R,δ (n, d) to be the maximum number M such that an (n, M, d) R,δ code exists. A fundamental task in coding theory is to determine for given n and d the number A R,δ (n, d), and to ﬁnd a corresponding optimal code. In the following we consider the case R = F 2 and δ = δ H , the Hamming metric, or R = Z 4 and δ = δ Lee , the Lee metric. We will use the simpliﬁed notations (n, M, d) for (n, M, d) F 2 ,δ H and (n, M, d) Z 4 for (n, M, d) Z 4 ,δ Lee .\nThe purpose of this paper is to provide further insight into the algebraic representation of some optimal non-linear binary codes. Our work is based on the quaternary constructions for the Best code and the Julin code given by Conway and Sloane, in fact, we take the algebraic representation in [3] a step further in that we involve the multiplicative structure of the ambient group ring. More speciﬁcally, we use the Fourier transform as well as subgroups of the unit group of a group ring to analyze the codes.\nAs a result, we obtain a new succint description of Best\u2019s (10, 40, 4) code as a subgroup coset in the unit group of the ring. This representation gives rise to a novel algebraic decoding algorithm for this code. We also apply this tech- nique to analyze Julin\u2019s (12, 144, 4) code and the (12, 24, 12) Hadamard code. We further use it to construct a (non-optimal) binary (14, 56, 6) code.\nIn the beginning of the 90s several optimal non-linear binary codes were recognized as Gray images of Z 4 -linear codes (see, e.g., [6]). Since then codes over Z 4 or over more general rings gained much attention in the literature.\nSetting δ Lee (x, y) = w Lee (x − y), it turns out that (Z 4 , δ Lee ) is isometric to (Z 2 2 , δ H ) via the Gray mapping\nwhere a, b ∈ {0, 1}. The componentwise extension of this mapping to Z n 4 yields an isometry between (Z n 4 , δ Lee ) and (Z 2n 2 , δ H ).\nWe note that in order to view a (non-linear) binary code as a linear code over Z 4 it is necessary that its cardinality is a power of 2. Here we are interested in codes that do not satisfy this condition.\nA natural algebraic framework for cyclic codes is provided by group rings. For a ﬁnite ring R the group ring R[Z n ] is the set of all R-valued functions on Z n , equipped with the natural addition and the multiplication that is given by the cyclic convolution, i.e.,\nLetting δ j , for j ∈ Z n , be the element in R[Z n ] deﬁned by δ j (j) = 1 and δ j (i) = 0 if i = j, we can write any element f ∈ R[Z n ] as a sum i∈Z n f (i)δ i . The element f will also be denoted sometimes by a vector (f (0), f (1), . . . , f (n−1)).\nUsing the concept of a group ring, a cyclic code of length n over the ring R can be understood as a subset in R[Z n ] that is closed under multiplication by the element δ 1 .\nNow we deﬁne the discrete Fourier transform and state its fundamental properties (cf. [4]).\nDeﬁnition 1. Let S ⊇ R be a ring extension that contains a primitive n-th root of unity ω. For f ∈ S[Z n ] deﬁne the Fourier transform ˆ f ∈ S[Z n ] by\nProposition 3. Suppose that n ∈ R × and S is a local ring. Deﬁne the inverse transform by\nWe will further use the following results. Lemma 4. For f, g ∈ R[Z n ] there holds\nProof: If there exists g ∈ R[Z n ] with f g = 1 then 1 = j (f g)(j) = \t i f (i) \t j g(j) , so that i f (i) is invertible.\nIt is possible to prove A F 2 ,δ H (10, 4) ≤ 40 by a modiﬁcation of the linear programming bound (see, e.g., [9, p. 541]). Best [1] came up with the construction of a binary code meeting this bound. This optimal binary (10, 40, 4) code consists of the words\ntogether with all cyclic shifts of these. The distance enumerator of Best\u2019s code is given by\nIts automorphism group is a semidirect product of the dihedral group D 5 and Z 5 2 and hence has 320 elements. Litsyn and Vardy [8] showed that Best\u2019s code is unique, i.e., any binary (10, 40, 4) code must be isometric to this code. Furthermore, it can be shown (cf. [1], [3]) that applying the so-called Construction A to the (10, 40, 4) code yields the densest sphere packing known in 10 dimensions.\nThe (10, 40, 4) Best code cannot be recognized as a sub- module over Z 4 , since the cardinality is not a power of 2. Nevertheless, it was observed by Conway and Sloane [3] that the Best code has a sensible interpretation as a code over Z 4 . Namely, deﬁne a code P ⊆ Z 5 4 consisting of all words\nand all cyclic shifts of these. This code has parameters (5, 40, 4) Z 4 and is called the pentacode. It can be shown that the Gray image of P is (up to equivalence) the (10, 40, 4) code discovered by Best. Furthermore, the code P is invariant under the automorphisms\n(a, b, c, d, e) → (−a, 2 − b, c, 2 − d, −e) , (a, b, c, d, e) → (b, c, d, e, a) ,\nIn order to apply the Fourier transform, we chose to analyze the pentacode, because Best\u2019s original binary code does not satisfy n ∈ F × 2 . For this we ﬁnd that the Galois ring GR(4, 4) as an extension of Z 4 contains the required primitive 5-th root of unity ω. The minimal polynomial of ω over Z 4 is given by\nWe computed the Fourier transform of all words of the pentacode. The result is shown in Table I. It is apparent that the spectrum of each word of P solely consists of invertible elements in GR(4, 4). We can further make the following\nˆ g := ( 1 , 3 ω + 2 , 3 ω 2 + 2 , 3 ω 3 + 2 , 3 ω 4 + 2 ) ˆ h := ( 1 , 2 ω + 3 , 2 ω 2 + 3 , 2 ω 3 + 3 , 2 ω 4 + 3 )\nThe preceeding observations lead to the following algebraic structure of the pentacode. By applying the inverse transform and doing some rescaling we obtain the vectors\nf = (1, 1, 1, 2, 0) , g = (2, 1, 0, 0, 0) , h = (1, 2, 0, 0, 0) .\nHere h 2 = 1 and g is of order 10. This yields the following theorem:\nTheorem 6. Let f, g, h ∈ Z 4 [Z 5 ] be as above. For each word c of the pentacode P there holds\nfor some i, j ∈ Z 2 and k ∈ Z 10 . Consequently, the pentacode is a coset\nwhere U is a 40 element subgroup of the group of invertible elements in the group ring S := Z 4 [Z 5 ].\nOne can prove that the ring S = Z 4 [Z 5 ] is isomorphic to GR(4, 4) × Z 4 , and hence the unit group S × is isomorphic to Z 4 2 × Z 15 × Z 2 ∼ = Z 5 2 × Z 3 × Z 5 (see [10]). From this it is easy to see that there are 5 3 2 = 155 subgroups U of order 40 in the unit group of S; here 5 3 2 denotes the Gaussian binomial coefﬁcient, i.e., the number of 3-dimensional subspaces of Z 5 2 . By a computer search we found that only 2 of these subgroups yield (up to equivalence) the pentacode. Moreover, the pentacode occurs twice among the 12 cosets of each of these two subgroups.\nThe four algebraic representations of the pentacode as f U , where f ∈ S and U is a subgroup of S × , are given in Table II. In each case, we state four generators of the subgroup U , which have order 5, 2, 2, and 2, respectively, and we chose the representative f to be of minimal degree in the \u2018polynomial\u2019 representation i∈Z\nf (i)δ i 1 . The original pentacode P of Theorem 6 is found as f 1,1 U 1 ; for this, note that g 5 = (1, 0, 0, 0, 2) and g 6 = (0, 1, 0, 0, 0).\nFor each subgroup U j , j = 1, 2, the pentacodes f j,1 U j and f j,2 U j are related as f j,2 U j = a f j,1 U j , where a = (3, 2, 2, 2, 2) / ∈ U j is a unit element; this element has the property that the left multiplication\nIn fact, the set of s ∈ S such that L s : S × → S × is an isometry of the unit group S × equals δ 1 , −1, a , whereas the set of s ∈ S such that L s : C → C is a code isometry equals\nδ 1 , −1 , for all four pentacodes C. In particular, not all left multiplications of elements in U j are isometries.\nWe note that [3] mentions also four pentacodes B 0 , B 1 , B 2 , B 3 , which are constructed as orbits of a group of isometries on Z 5 4 . Here, B 0 equals f 1,1 U 1 and B 2 equals f 1,2 U 1 , whereas B 1 and B 3 are different from f 2,1 U 2 and f 2,2 U 2 .\nWe present a simple decoding algorithm for the pentacode which is based on its algebraic representation as f U in the group ring. The decoding algorithm differs considerably from the one given in [3].\nIn the following we will write f g for the convolution f g in a group ring. For concreteness we consider in the ring S = Z 4 [Z 5 ] the pentacode C = f 2,1 U 2 = f U , with f = (3, 3, 2, 1, 0) = (0, 1, 1, 1, 2) −1 ∈ C and U = U 2 = δ 1 , −1, g, h , where g = (1, 0, 2, 0, 0) = 2δ 2 + 1 and h = (1, 0, 0, 2, 0) = 2δ 3 + 1. Hence C is given as\nProof: An element u ∈ U is of the form (−1) i g j h k δ = (2 + 1) i (2δ 2 + 1) j (2δ 3 + 1) k δ = 2 (i + j δ 2 + k δ 3 ) + 1 δ , for some ∈ Z 5 and i, j, k ∈ Z 2 .\nGiven y ∈ S we can check whether y ∈ C = f U by applying the test of Lemma 7 to z = f −1 y. In case y ∈ C we also obtain this way the \u2018message\u2019 (i, j, k, ) ∈ Z 3 2 × Z 5 .\nNow we present a decoding algorithm for the pentacode C. Let y ∈ S be the received vector, and assume that y = c + e = f u + e, where c ∈ C, u ∈ U , and e ∈ S is an error vector of Lee weight ≤ 2. We note that f −1 = (0, 1, 1, 1, 2).\n[In fact, z = u + f −1 e. Note that u ≡ δ mod 2, so that w H (u mod 2) = 1. Furthermore, w H (f −1 e mod 2) is odd if and only if w H (e mod 2) is odd.]\n2a) Case w H (z mod 2) odd: Check if z ∈ U by applying Lemma 7. If yes, conclude that no error occurred, and output the corresponding message (i, j, k, ); if no, conclude that two errors occurred.\n[Note that w H (e mod 2) is even.] 2b) Case w H (z mod 2) even:\n[Note that w H (e mod 2) is odd, and hence e = ±δ r for some r ∈ Z 5 . We thus have z = u ± δ r f −1 , where u = δ 2 (i + j δ 2 + k δ 3 ) + 1 for some ∈ Z 5 and i, j, k ∈ Z 2 .]\nDetermine ∈ Z 5 , r ∈ Z 5 , and a sign according to the following table (with m ∈ Z 5 to be chosen):\n(o, ±1, o, o, 2) \t (0, 0, ±) (o, o, ±1, o, 0) \t (3, 4, ±) (o, ±1, e, 2, e) \t (2, 4, ±) (±1, o, e, 0, e) \t (4, 3, ±)\nHere e stands for an even element and o for an odd element of Z 4 .\n[Note that f −1 = (0, 1, 1, 1, 2) and 2 (i + j δ 2 + k δ 3 ) + 1 is of the form (o, 0, e, e, 0).]\nThen δ − (z δ r f −1 ) = 2 (i + j δ 2 + k δ 3 ) + 1 for some i, j, k ∈ Z 2 ; output the message (i, j, k, ).\nIt is not hard to see that the pattern given in the table determine uniquely ∈ Z 5 , r ∈ Z 5 , and the sign of the error e = ±δ r . Thus, the decoding algorithm corrects all errors of Lee weight 1 and detects all errors of Lee weight 2. This shows again that the code has minimum Lee distance 4.\nThe Gray images of Z 4 -codes of the form f U , where f ∈ S = Z 4 [Z n ] and U is a subgroup of the unit group S × , yield good binary codes in many cases. For example, binary codes with parameters (6, 4, 4), (8, 16, 4), (10, 40, 4), (12, 128, 4), (14, 392, 4), (12, 24, 6), and (14, 56, 6) can be constructed this way. In this section we study some of these cases as well as the (12, 144, 4) Julin code in greater detail. We start with a preliminary observation.\nProposition 8. Let S := Z 4 [Z n ], let f ∈ S and U ⊆ S × , and let C := f U . Then the Lee distance between two codewords of C is even, in particular the minimum Lee distance of the code C is even.\nProof: Let S odd := {f ∈ S | i f (i) ∈ Z × 4 = {1, 3}} and let S even := S \\ S odd . By Corollary 5, U ⊆ S × ⊆ S odd .\nCase 1: f ∈ S odd . Then from Lemma 4 it follows C = f U ⊆ S odd . Let c, c ∈ C ⊆ S odd . Then i (c − c )(i) =\nc(i) − i c (i) is even, so that c − c ∈ S even . It follows that w Lee (c − c ) = i w Lee (c − c )(i) is even.\nCase 2: f ∈ S even . Then from Lemma 4 it follows C = f U ⊆ S even . As before, for c, c ∈ C it follows c−c ∈ S even and thus w Lee (c − c ) is even.\nJulin\u2019s binary (12, 144, 4) code [7] (see also [9, p. 70f]) can be constructed by taking as words the 132 blocks of a Steiner S(5, 6, 12) system and adding six words each of weight 2 and 10. The code was shown to be optimal in [11]. Conway and Sloane [3] provided a quaternary construction for a canonical version of the Julin code. In this construction one deﬁnes the vectors\nWe performed a spectral analysis of the quaternary Julin code J . Although n = 6 is not a unit in characteristic 4, the Fourier transform provided us with enough information to ﬁnd the following algebraic representation.\nLet S be the group ring Z 4 [Z 6 ], and let g = (0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) ∈ S which is an invertible element of order 2. We consider the subgroup U of S × generated by −1, δ 1 , and g, which has 24 elements.\nThen J is invariant under the group U ; it is actually a union of 8 cosets of U . More concretely, J can be written as\n∪ c 5 ({(0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 3), (1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3)} U ) ∪ c 1 (0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1) U ∪ c 11 U .\nThe binary (12, 24, 6) binary Hadamard code (see, e.g., [9, p. 49]) is constructed from a Hadamard matrix H of order 12, and such a matrix can be obtained from the Paley construction. The Hadamard matrix H is changed into a binary matrix A, where +1 s are replaced by 0 s and −1 s by 1 s. Then the Hadamard code consists of all rows of the matrix A, together with their complements. From the deﬁnition of Hadamard matrix the code has parameters (12, 24, 6), which can be seen to be optimal by applying the Plotkin bound (see [9, p. 43]).\nWe now give an algebraic representation of a quaternary (6, 24, 6) Z 4 by using again the group ring S = Z 4 [Z 6 ]. Let U be the subgroup of S × generated by the elements (2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1), (0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3), and (2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0) of order 2, as well as the element (0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0) of order 3. Then U has 24 elements, and\nwith f = (0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0) deﬁnes a (6, 24, 6) Z 4 code. It can be shown that the Gray map of C is a translation of a (12, 24, 6) Hadamard code.\nWe remark that a binary (12, 24, 6) code was not found in a similar way in the binary group ring Z 2 [Z 12 ].\nWe performed a computer search to obtain an interesting heptacode. For this we took a similar avenue as for the Best code and deﬁne:\nf = (1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 0, 0) g = (2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) h = (1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)\nwhich has 56 words and is of minimum Lee distance 6. The code turns out to be distance-invariant and its distance enumerator is given by\nThe Gray image of H is a binary (14, 56, 6) code. Consult- ing Grassl\u2019s tables [5] we ﬁnd that for a linear binary code only the parameters (14, 2 5 , 6) are possible. From Brouwer\u2019s table [2] however we ﬁnd a strong competitor, namely the dou- bly shortened Nordstrom-Robinson code, which is a (14, 64, 6) code.\nWe remark that by shortening the code H we get a code with parameters (13, 28, 6), which are the same as for the so- called conference matrix code of length 13 (see [9, p. 57]).\nIn this paper we provided new insights into the algebraic representation of Best\u2019s (10, 40, 4) code and other non-linear binary codes. We established the discrete Fourier transform\nas a useful tool when analyzing non-linear codes, and found a presentation of certain optimal non-linear binary codes as coset(s) of a subgroup in the unit group of a ring. It is an open problem whether asymptotically good codes can be obtained by this method.\nThe authors would like to thank Michael Kiermaier and Oliver Gnilke for inspiring discussions.
