The  joint typical  decoder (JT  decoder)  similar to the one proposed  by  Akcakaya and  Tarokh is used to avoid dependence on particular choice of  recovery routines. The following interesting results  have  been obtained: 1) The detection failure probability linearly  converges to zero as the number of sensors increases. 2) The  number of compressed measurements per sensor (PSM)  needed for successful recovery converges to sparsity as the  number of sensors increases. \nKeywords-Compressed  Sensing, Joint Typicality,  Distributed Source Coding, Distributed Compressed Sensing.
