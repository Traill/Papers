Then for every distribution x such that E xx T S, we have\nThe above extremal inequality is interesting and important in its own right. It has been used in the proof of the capacity region of the reversely degraded Gaussian MIMO BC with a common message and two private messages [2], the capacity region of the Gaussian MIMO BC with a common message and a conﬁdential message [3], the capacity region of some classes of degraded compound multi-receiver wiretap channels [4], the capacity region of the Gaussian MIMO BC with a common message and two conﬁdential messages [5] as well as the capacity-equivocation region of the Gaussian MIMO wiretap channel [6].\nIn this paper, we prove a generalization of the above extremal inequality, which we believe will ﬁnd applications in the proof of other capacity theorems for multi-user net- works. We follow a similar perturbation approach adopted by Weingarten et al. to prove the above extremal inequality. For the generalized extremal inequality, we require the additional use of the data processing inequality. Finally, we apply the generalized extremal inequality to characterize the capacity region of the N -user compound MIMO BC, a generalization of the two-user case.\nIn the N -user compound MIMO BC, user n ∈ {1, . . . , N} has K n possible realizations such that\nwhere x is a real input vector of size t ×1; y n i n is a real output vector of size t × 1 corresponding to realization i n of user n;\nRemark 2: There is a slight change in notation in Theorem 1 as the extremal inequality is more general than that required to prove the capacity region of the N -user compound MIMO BC. We may set N L,n l n = N n i n and N R,n r n = N n +1 i n +1 to prove the capacity region of the N -user case. However, since extremal inequalities are often useful in proving capacity theorems in multi-user networks, we gave the most general extension we could. We immediately recover Lemma 1 from Theorem 1. We also recover the extremal inequalities in [7, Lem. 5 and Lem. 6], which were necessary to prove the capacity region of the Gaussian MIMO three-receiver BC with two- degraded message sets. Theorem 1 may also be used to prove, without the need for channel enhancement, the capacity region of the N -user degraded Gaussian MIMO BC with private messages as well as the non-degraded case using the channel enhancement technique. The proofs of these follow along the lines for the proof of the N -user compound MIMO BC in this paper and hence, are omitted due to space limitations.\nThe capacity region of the N -user compound MIMO BC is stated in the following theorem and the proof is given in Section IV.\nTheorem 2: The capacity region of the channel given in (5) and satisfying (6), C DC (S), is given by the set of rate tuples (R 1 , . . . , R N ) such that\nQ i and S N S, for some Q n 0, n ∈ {1, . . . , N − 1}, and S N −1 S.\nAs we shall rely heavily on Fisher information matrices and Fisher information inequalities to prove the generalized extremal inequality, we provide some deﬁnitions and auxiliary results in this section.\nis independent of (u 1 , . . . , u N −1 , x ). We note that x n,γ can also be expressed as follows:\nWe wish to show that for any distribution u N −1 → . . . → u 1 → x satisfying E xx T \t S, we must have g \u2032 (γ) ≥ 0, ∀γ ∈ [ 0, 1 ).\nUsing the vector form of deBruijn\u2019s identity (see [10, Prop. 7]), and the fact that we may exchange the order of integral and derivative (see [7, Appen. I]), we obtain\n(16) Next, we lower bound the summands of the ﬁrst sum in the\nand y = ˜ z n ∼ N 0, T ∗ n − N L,n l n in Lemma 3 (its conditional form), and with some manipulations, we obtain\nx = x n,γ + z ∗ n , where z ∗ n ∼ N (0, T ∗ n ) and y = ˜ z n ∼ N 0, N R,n r n − T ∗ n in Lemma 3 (its conditional form), and with some manipulations, we obtain\nTo bound the ﬁrst term, we note that J (x 1,γ + z ∗ 1 |u 1 ) J (z ∗ 1 ) = T ∗−1 1 . Hence, we have\nThis follows from Lemma (4). To upper bound the second term in (22), we note that J √γw G n + ˆ z ∗ n −1 \t J ˆ z ∗ n −1 =\nFinally, using the bounds for the summands in the second summation of (19), given by (22)-(24), we obtain for the three summations in (19)\nTherefore, g \u2032 (γ) is non-negative for γ ∈ [ 0, 1 ) and the proof is complete.\nIn the ﬁnal section, we complete the proof of the capacity region of the N -user compound MIMO BC. We ﬁrst give a single letter characterization of the discrete case in the following lemma:\nLemma 5: Consider a discrete memoryless compound BC with input X and outputs Y n i n , i n ∈ {1, 2, . . . , K n }, for the n th user, n = 1, 2, . . . , N . There are also N − 1 auxiliary outputs Y ∗ n , n = 1, 2, . . . , N − 1. All outputs are deﬁned by their conditional probability mass functions: P Y n in |X and P Y ∗ n |X . Furthermore, assume that for each i n ∈ {1, 2, . . . , K n }, n = 1, 2, . . . , N − 1, there exists a joint conditional probability distribution with marginal distributions P Y n in |X and P Y ∗ n |X and where the following Markov chain holds:\nThe capacity region of this channel is given by R n ≤ min\nwhere U N ∅ and U 0 X and for some (X, U 1 , . . . , U N −1 ) where\n  \n  \nwhere (a) follows from (30) and (26); (b) from the fact that the ﬁrst term in (32) is maximized by Gaussian inputs with Cov (x) = S. Furthermore, since the conditions of Lemma 6 satisfy the conditions of Theorem 1, the second and third terms are upper bounded by the optimal Gaussian inputs satisfying the conditions of Lemma 6. Hence, we may upper bound (32) by (33); and (c) follows from (30) and (31).\nSince the upper bound is achievable with zero-mean Gaus- sian inputs, this concludes the proof of Theorem 2."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"H.
