In this paper, secrecy gains of several 2- and 3-modular lattices are computed. Most are shown to have a secrecy gain larger than the best unimodular lattices can achieve."},"body":{"text":"The wiretap channel was introduced by Wyner [2] as a discrete memoryless broadcast channel where the sender Alice transmits conﬁdential messages to a legitimate receiver Bob, in the presence of an eavesdropper Eve. Both reliable and conﬁdential communication between Alice and Bob should be ensured at the same time, by exploiting the physical difference between the channel to Bob and that to Eve via coding. A survey on this topic is available in [3]. Many results of information theoretical nature are available for various classes of channels capturing the trade-off between reliability and secrecy and aiming at determining the highest information rate that can be achieved with perfect secrecy, the so-called secrecy capacity . Coding results on constructing concrete codes that can be implemented in a speciﬁc channel are much fewer (see e.g. [4], [5] for examples of wiretap codes dealing with channels with erasures).\nIn this paper, we discuss Gaussian wiretap channels, whose secrecy capacity was established in [6]. Examples of existing Gaussian wiretap codes were designed for binary inputs, as in [7]. A different approach was adopted in [1], where lattice codes were proposed, using as design criterion a new lattice invariant called secrecy gain, which was shown to characterize the confusion at the eavesdropper. This suggests the study of the secrecy gain of lattices as a way to understand how to design a good Gaussian wiretap code. So far, the special class of unimodular lattices has been studied with particular emphasis on even unimodular lattices [8], [9]: the secrecy gain of extremal even unimodular lattices was computed, and the asymptotic behavior of the average secrecy gain as a function of the dimension n was investigated. The results show that maximizing the secrecy gain is meaningful in small dimen- sions and inﬁnite secrecy gain (implying complete secrecy) is possible as n grows to inﬁnity. Unimodular lattices in small dimensions, both odd and even, were considered in [10], [11] resulting in a complete classiﬁcation in dimension n, n ≤ 23,\nfeaturing some odd lattices outperforming their even counter parts. It is natural to wonder whether other classes of lattices would have a better secrecy gain. The contribution of this paper is to initiate the study of the secrecy gain of other modular lattices. Since the secrecy gain depends on the theta series of the lattice considered, it makes sense to start with even 2- and 3-modular lattices, whose theta series have a decomposition formula similar to that of even unimodular lattices. Our results show that 2- and 3-modular lattices indeed achieve a secrecy gain larger than that of unimodular lattices in all the dimensions treated so far, but for n = 22.\nA Gaussian wiretap channel is a broadcast Gaussian channel modeled by\nwhere x is the codeword sent by the transmitter (Alice), y and z are the received signals at the legitimate receiver (Bob), respectively at the eavesdropper (Eve), with corresponding noise vectors v b and v e , whose components are i.i.d. Gaussian distributed with zero mean and respective variance σ 2 b and σ 2 e .\nIt is assumed that σ 2 b < σ 2 e in order to have a positive secrecy capacity [6]. We suppose that x ∈ R n is a lattice codeword, where by a lattice Λ we mean a discrete set of points in R n , which can be conveniently described by\nwhere the generator matrix M stores as row vectors a basis for the lattice.\nLattice encoding for the wiretap channel (1) is done via a generic coset coding strategy [1]: let Λ e ⊂ Λ b be two nested lattices, specially chosen such that the quotient group Λ b /Λ e is of size 2 k . A k-bit message is then mapped to a coset in Λ b /Λ e , after which a vector is randomly chosen from the coset as the encoded word. The lattice Λ e will be interpreted as introducing confusion for Eve, while Λ b as ensuring reliability for Bob. A bound on Eve\u2019s probability P c,e of correct decoding shows [1] that to minimize P c,e is to minimize\nwhere ||t|| 2 = t · t is the norm (squared length) of a lattice point. Let H = {a + ib ∈ C|b > 0} denote the upper half plane and set\nIt can be easily recognized that (2) is in fact the theta series of Λ e at τ = i 2πσ 2\n. Motivated by the above argument, the confusion brought by the lattice Λ e with respect to no coding (namely, use the lattice Z n scaled to the same volume, where the volume vol(Λ) of a lattice Λ is by deﬁnition the determinant of its generator matrix) is measured as follows [1]:\nDeﬁnition 2.2: Let Λ be an n-dimensional lattice of volume V . The secrecy function of Λ is given by\nThe secrecy gain is then the maximal value of the secrecy function with respect to τ and is denoted by χ Λ .\nThe theta series of a lattice is in general difﬁcult to analyze except for special classes of lattices. We will take a closer look at one of them, the family of -modular lattices. The dual of a lattice Λ of dimension n is deﬁned to be\nΛ is said to be an integral lattice if Λ ⊂ Λ ∗ . The norm of any lattice point in an integral lattice Λ is always an integer. If the norm is even for any lattice point, then Λ is called an even lattice. Otherwise, it is called an odd lattice. The theta series of an integral lattice has a neat representation. Since the norms are all integers, we can combine the terms with the same norm and write\nA lattice is said to be equivalent, or geometrically similar to its dual, if it differs from its dual only by possibly a rotation, reﬂection and change of scale. An integral lattice that is equivalent to its dual is called a modular lattice. Or as it was ﬁrst deﬁned by H.-G. Quebbemann [12], an n-dimensional integral lattice Λ is modular if there exists a similarity σ of R n such that σ(Λ ∗ ) = Λ. If σ multiplies norms by , Λ is said to be -modular. In the particular case when the similarity factor\n= 1, such lattices are unimodular lattices, corresponding to the more familiar deﬁnition Λ = Λ ∗ . It can be shown that if Λ is an -modular lattice of dimension n, then\nWe will need the following concepts and formulae from analytic number theory for our discussion, for which we refer the readers to [13], [14] for more details.\nDeﬁnition 2.3: The Jacobi theta functions are deﬁned as follows:\n  \n \nϑ 2 (τ ) = Σ n∈Z q (n+ 1 2 ) 2 , ϑ 3 (τ ) = Σ n∈Z q n 2 ,\nThe Jacobi theta functions and the Dedekind eta function are connected as follows [13]:\n   \n  \nLemma 2.5: The theta series of an even -modular lattice of dimension n = 2k when \t = 1, 2, 3 belongs to a space of modular forms of weight k generated by the functions Θ λ 2k\n(τ ) with integers λ, µ ≥ 0 satisfying k 0 λ + k 1 µ = k, where for = 1, 2, 3, k 0 = 4, 2, 1 respectively, k 1 = 24 1+ , Θ 2k 0 (τ ) denote the theta series of the modular lattices E 8 , D 4 and A 2 , respectively, and ∆ 2k 1 (τ ) = (η(τ )η( τ )) k 1 .\nExample 2.6: If = 1, corresponding to the unimodular case, we know from Lemma 2.5 that k 0 = 4, k 1 = 24 2 = 12, Θ 2k 0 (τ ) = Θ E 8 (τ ), ∆ 2k 1 (τ ) = η 24 (τ ), from which we deduce that if Λ is an even unimodular lattice of dimension n = 2k then\nThe formula (6) was adopted in [8], [9] to compute the secrecy gains of several even unimodular lattices.\nLattices that are equivalent to their duals were shown to have a symmetry point, called weak secrecy gain, at τ = \t i vol\nin their secrecy function [9]. It was conjectured in the same paper that for these lattices, the weak secrecy gain is actually the secrecy gain. This conjecture was recently proven by A.- M. Ernvall-Hyt¨onen [15] for a special class of lattices called extremal even unimodular lattices and by F. Lin and F. Oggier [11] for unimodular lattices in dimension n, 8 < n ≤ 23. In this paper, we still use χ Λ to denote the weak secrecy gain. We will compute the weak secrecy gains of known even 2- and 3-modular lattices, and claim that their secrecy gains are larger than that of unimodular lattices in the same dimension, since the secrecy gain is by deﬁnition the maximum of the secrecy function.\nIn order to write the secrecy function, we need to have the theta series of Z n scaled to the right volume. Recall the\ndeﬁnition of the theta series of a lattice and the Jacobi theta function ϑ 3 (τ ). We have that\n \nAccording to Lemma 2.5, the theta series of an even 2- modular lattice Λ of dimension n = 2k can be written as\nΘ D 4 (τ ) = 1 2 ϑ 4 3 (τ ) + ϑ 4 4 (τ ) = 1 + 24q 2 + 24q 4 + 96q 6 + · · · (10)\nBy (5), we can write ∆ 16 (τ ) in terms of Jacobi theta functions and compute the ﬁrst few terms:\n(11) The secrecy function of an even 2-modular lattice Λ of dimension n is then written as\n(τ )∆ µ 16 (τ ) , or more conveniently,\nNow we only need to know the coefﬁcients a µ in order to compute the weak secrecy gain of a 2-modular lattice, once the following two quotients are computed:\nWe recognize that α 2 is basically the weak secrecy gain of the 2-modular lattice D 4 (or rather its inverse). Fig. 1 gives a plot of the secrecy function of D 4 , where (i) we set y = −iτ and restrict to real positive values of y, since by (2) we are only interested in the values of Θ D 4 (τ ) with τ = yi, y > 0 and (ii) y is plotted in decibels to transform the multiplicative symmetry point into an additive symmetry point. We can see clearly that the secrecy function has a symmetry point at y ≈ −1.5 dB corresponding to τ = i √ 2 . The value of the secrecy function Θ D 4 (τ ) = ϑ 4 3 (\nat τ = i √ 2 , namely, the weak secrecy gain can be approximated by\n. The value of the ratio at τ = i √ 2 can be approximated by\nWe start by explaining how the coefﬁcients a µ \u2019s in (9) are computed. By substituting (10) and (11) into (9), we have a formal sum with coefﬁcients represented by the a µ \u2019s. Then by comparing this formal sum with (3), we obtain a number of linear equations in the a µ \u2019s. When we have enough equations, the a µ \u2019s can be recovered by solving a linear system. Now, let us compute the weak secrecy gain of the 16-dimensional 2-modular Barnes-Wall lattice BW 16 as an example.\nExample 3.1: BW 16 is an even lattice with minimum norm 4. The theta series of BW 16 looks like\n= a 0 (1 + 24q 2 + · · · ) 4 + a 1 (q 2 + · · · ) = a 0 (1 + 96q 2 + · · · ) + a 1 (q 2 + · · · ) = a 0 + (96a 0 + a 1 )q 2 + · · · .\na 0 \t = 1 96a 0 + a 1 = 0\nwhich gives a 0 = 1 and a 1 = −96, yielding the weak secrecy gain\nSee Figure 3 for a plot of the secrecy function of BW 16 for veriﬁcation.\nIn this way, we have computed the weak secrecy gains of the even 2-modular lattices we found in [16] in dimensions smaller than 24 as shown in Table I.\nAccording to Lemma 2.5, the theta series of an even 3- modular lattice Λ of dimension n = 2k can be written as\nThe secrecy function of an even 3-modular lattice Λ of dimension n is\n \nwhere we recognize in the ﬁrst term the inverse of the weak secrecy gain of the 3-modular lattice A 2 . Fig. 4 gives a plot of the secrecy function of A 2 and the weak secrecy gain is approximated by\nThe second term β 3 is approximated numerically as we did for β 2 and is omitted.\nNow let us compute the weak secrecy gain of the Coxeter- Todd Lattice K 12 as an example.\nExample 3.2: The Coxeter-Todd Lattice K 12 is an even lattice with minimum norm 4. The theta series of K 12 looks like\nOn the other hand, by (16), (17) and (18), Θ K 12 (τ ) = a 0 Θ 6 A 2 (τ ) + a 1 ∆ 12 (τ )\n= a 0 (1 + 6q 2 + · · · ) 6 + a 1 (q 2 + · · · ) = a 0 (1 + 36q 2 + · · · ) + a 1 (q 2 + · · · ) = a 0 + (36a 0 + a 1 )q 2 + · · · .\na 0 \t = 1 36a 0 + a 1 = 0\nwhich gives a 0 = 1 and a 1 = −36, yielding the weak secrecy gain\nSee Fig. 5 for a plot of the secrecy function of K 12 for veriﬁcation.\nWeak secrecy gains of the even 3-modular lattices in di- mensions smaller than 24 in [16] are also shown in Table I.\nNow that we have computed the weak secrecy gains of sev- eral 2- and 3-modular lattices, we want to compare them with the best unimodular lattices in their respective dimensions. Table II lists the secrecy gains of the best unimodular lattices and the weak secrecy gains of the even 2- and 3-modular lattices we have computed. We can see that all 2- and 3- modular lattices outperform the unimodular lattices except for the 22-dimensional 3-modular lattice A 2 × A 11 .\nIn this paper, we investigate the secrecy gain of even 2- and 3-modular lattices. A formula similar to that for even unimodular lattices [8], [9] is derived and weak secrecy gains of even 2- and 3-modular lattices in dimensions smaller than 24 are computed. They are found to be larger than that of the best unimodular lattices, classiﬁed in [11], with an exception of that of the lattice A 2 × A 11 . One direction of future work will be naturally to look at the performance of -modular lattices, > 3. Another direction would be to study the asymptotic behavior of the weak secrecy gain of the even 2-\nand 3-modular lattices. Besides, it is likely that one can prove the conjecture for these particular cases using the same proof technique as in [11], however it would be nice to have a more general proof. Also, the encoding/labeling of the proposed wiretap codes, taking into account both channel parameters and power constraint are being naturally elaborated.\nThe research of F. Lin and F.
