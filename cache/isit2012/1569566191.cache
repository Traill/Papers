For any set of channel coefﬁcients, this rate region contains points within a constant gap from the sum capacity boundary of the MAC. The main tool used is the recently proposed compute-and-forward framework. A new transformation of a MAC to a modulo-lattice multiple- input multiple-output (MIMO) channel is introduced based on this framework. Speciﬁcally, from one noisy linear combination of the transmitted signals the receiver attempts to decode K linearly independent equations with integer-valued coefﬁcients. While the individual rates at which these equations can be decoded are highly sensitive to the exact channel gains, their sum is always within a constant gap from the sum capacity boundary of the MAC. The transformation is then utilized for establishing the desired rate region."},"body":{"text":"transform , due to its close connection to the original compute- and-forward scheme for relay networks [8]. This technique can either be viewed as a building block for interference alignment for static channels or, more generally, as an approximately sum rate optimal multiple-access scheme that requires only a single layer of codewords.\nIn a relay network, the basic idea underlying compute-and- forward is that each relay should decode an integer combina- tion of the transmitted lattice points. The effective signal-to- noise ratio (SNR) is determined by how closely the integer coefﬁcients match the channel coefﬁcients. For the multiple- access setting with K users, the receiver should instead decode K linearly independent equations of the transmitted lattice points. Then, these equations can be solved for the lattice points transmitted by each user. This approach is connected to the integer-forcing receiver recently proposed for multiple- antenna point-to-point channels [9]. A striking phenomenon that, to the best of our knowledge, has gone unnoticed is that while the computation rate for each of the K equations is very sensitive to the exact channel gains, the sum of the rates is equal to the sum-capacity of the MAC up to a constant gap, independent of the channel gains and the SNR (see Figure 1). To achieve this sum rate, our scheme associates each of the computation rates to a speciﬁc transmitter and decodes the equations using a form of successive interference cancellation tailored to the modulo-lattice structure. Below, we develop the compute-and-forward transform within the context of a Gaussian MAC. Due to space limitations proofs are omitted and the reader is referred to [10] for the full details.\nIn this section we give some basic deﬁnitions and results that will be used in the sequel.\nwhere h = [h 1 · · · h K ] T ∈ R K is the vector of channel gains, x k ∈ R n , k = 1, · · · , K are the channel inputs, z ∈ R n is additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) with zero mean and unit variance and y ∈ R n is the channel\u2019s output. Without loss of generality we assume all K users are subject to the\nΛ ⊆ Λ K ⊆ · · · ⊆ Λ 1 . From these lattices, we construct K codebooks, one for each user. Speciﬁcally, user k is allocated the codebook L k = Λ θ(k) ∩ V, where V is the Voronoi region of Λ and the function θ(k) : {1, . . . , K} → {1, . . . , K} maps between users and lattices. The rate of each codebook L k is R k = 1 / n log |Λ θ(k) ∩ V|.\nUser k encodes its message onto a lattice point from its codebook, t k ∈ L k . Each user also has a random 2 dither vector d k which is generated independently and uniformly over V. These dithers are made available to the decoder. The signal transmitted by user k is\nOur objective is to communicate over the MAC using the compute-and-forward scheme from [8]. To this aim, the receiver ﬁrst decodes a set of K lattice equations with linearly independent coefﬁcient vectors. Afterwards, it solves this set of equations for the transmitted lattice points. Assume the receiver is interested in decoding the lattice equation v = \t K k=1 a k t k mod Λ with coefﬁcient vector a = [a 1 · · · a K ] T ∈ Z K . Following the scheme of [8], the receiver scales the observation y by a factor β, removes the dithers, and reduces modulo Λ to get\nis effective noise. From [8], we have that z eff (h, a, β) is statistically independent of v and its effective variance 3 is\nLet θ ∗ = min k:a k =0 θ(k) be the index of the densest lattice participating in the lattice equation v.

The receiver, which sees a noisy real-valued linear combination of the transmitted codewords, begins by decoding the integer-valued linear combination v 1 = [ a 1m t m ] mod Λ which yields the highest computa- tion rate R comp ,1 . Using the compute-and-forward framework, this is possible if R 1 < R comp ,1 . Then, it proceeds to decode the equation v 2 = [ a 2m t m ] mod Λ which yields the second highest computation rate R comp ,2 . In general, t 1 participates in this equation and the condition for correct decoding of v 2 is therefore R 1 < R comp ,2 . Nevertheless, this condition can be relaxed using the ﬁrst equation v 1 that was already decoded. Speciﬁcally, after appropriate scaling of the channel\u2019s output and dithers removal, the receiver has a noisy observation\nof the desired equation v 2 . If t 1 participates in v 1 , it is possible to cancel out t 1 from the second equation by adding a scaled version of v 1 to s 2 . Namely, the re- ceiver adds r 21 v 1 to s 2 , where r 21 is an integer cho- sen such that [(a 11 + r 21 a 21 )] mod p = 0, which assures [(a 11 + r 21 a 21 )t 1 ] mod Λ = 0 for any t 1 ∈ L 1 . After reducing modΛ this yields\ns SI 2 = [v 2 + r 21 v 1 + z eff (h, a 2 )] mod Λ = [˜ v 2 + z eff (h, a 2 )] mod Λ,\nwhere t 1 does not participate in ˜ v 2 . Since the effective noise z eff (h, a 2 ) is unchanged by this process, the receiver can decode ˜ v 2 as long as R 2 < R comp ,2 . Now, the receiver can get v 2 by subtracting r 21 v 1 from ˜ v 2 and reducing modΛ. 4 The receiver decodes the remaining equations in a similar manner, i.e., before decoding the kth equation v k with computation rate R comp ,k the receiver adds to\nan integer-valued linear combination k−1 ℓ=1 r kℓ v ℓ mod Λ of the lattice equations that were already decoded. The coefﬁ- cients in the linear combination are chosen such that the effect of t 1 , . . . , t k−1 is canceled out from v k . Assuming that such coefﬁcients {r k1 , . . . , r k,k−1 } exist the receiver can decode ˜ v k = v k + k−1 ℓ=1 r kℓ v ℓ mod Λ as long as R k < R comp ,k .\nIn [10], we show that for any set of K linearly independent coefﬁcient vectors {a 1 , . . . , a K } there indeed always exist integer-valued coefﬁcients {r ij } such that in each kth decod- ing step the receiver can cancel out k−1 lattice points from the desired equation v k , using the previously decoded equations {v 1 , . . . , v k−1 }. The procedure for ﬁnding these coefﬁcients is reminiscent to the Gaussian elimination procedure of a full rank matrix.
