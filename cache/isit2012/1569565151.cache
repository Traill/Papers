The (honest) central switch makes the communication sent by each node available to all the other nodes. However, a subset of the nodes may drop out before the communication protocol is completed. The remaining nodes must agree upon an SK that is concealed from the (curious) central switch. Such fault-tolerant SK generation facilitates secure group communication for mobile nodes in a wireless environment.\nWe consider a multiterminal source model, and assume noiseless communication between the nodes and the central switch. Fixing the number of rounds of interaction, we for- mulate a notion of fault-tolerant SK capacity. This extends the concept of multiterminal SK capacity deﬁned in [3]. We provide an upper bound on the fault-tolerant SK capacity.\nOur upper bound is tight for two important source models of practical interest. For the ﬁrst model involving exchangeable random variables (rvs) (see, for instance, [4, p. 365]), our results show that the fault-tolerant SK capacity does not improve with rounds of interaction. Furthermore, our achiev- ability scheme shows the existence of an adaptive protocol that generates an SK of optimum rate for any remaining subset of nodes.\nThe second model we consider is a pairwise independent network (PIN) introduced in [5], [6]. This source model con- sists of independent bits shared by pairs of nodes, unknown to the central switch. These pairwise shared bits are represented as edges of a multigraph with nodes as the vertices. In [5], [6], an interactive protocol was provided to generate one bit of SK when this multigraph is a spanning tree. For a (t + 1)- connected multigraph, we present a noninteractive and fault- tolerant generalization of this protocol that generates one bit of SK if up to t nodes drop out. For the symmetric case of a complete graph, we use a modiﬁcation of this protocol to achieve a fault-tolerant SK rate that matches the one given by the aforementioned upper bound, thus characterizing the fault-tolerant SK capacity in this case. In fact, we show that it is possible for the the nodes to agree with probability one on an SK of optimal rate that is statistically independent of the communication sent by the nodes; such an SK is termed a perfect SK. Furthermore, this SK can be generated using a noninteractive protocol. Moreover, our protocol generates a perfect SK of optimum rate for any remaining subset of nodes.\nIn the context of computational secrecy, a dynamic group extension of the Difﬁe-Hellman SK generation algorithm was presented in [7]. The information-theoretic formulation here, however, is new.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. The basic concepts of SK and SK capacity are deﬁned in Section II. The notions of fault-tolerant SK and fault-tolerant SK capacities, along with our main results, are given in Section III.\nWe establish some notation here. The set {1, . . . , m} is denoted by M. Let X 1 , . . . , X m , m ≥ 2, be rvs taking values in ﬁnite sets X 1 , . . . , X m , respectively, and with a known probability mass function. For i ∈ M and n ≥ 1, let X n i\ndenote n independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) copies of X i . For a subset A ⊆ M, denote by X A the rvs (X i , i ∈ A), and by X n A the rvs (X n i , i ∈ A). Given R i ≥ 0, 1 ≤ i ≤ m, let R A denote the quantity i∈A R i .\nFinally, for 0 ≤ < 1, we say an rv U is -recoverable from an rv V if there exists a function g of V such that Pr (U = g(V )) ≥ 1 − .\nWe consider the multiterminal source model of [3]. Nodes 1, . . . , m observe rvs X n 1 , . . . , X n m , respectively. The com- munication between the nodes is enabled by a bidirectional central switch ; any communication received by the switch is made available (exactly) to all the nodes. The communication transmitted by the ith node may be randomized using a locally available rv U i . The rv U i is jointly independent of\n(X n M , U j , j ∈ M \\ {i}), and the rvs U M := (U 1 , . . . , U m ) satisfy H (U M ) < ∞. Throughout this paper, we assume that any communication originating from node i, i ∈ M, is stamped with header information that identiﬁes i.\nDeﬁnition 1. An r-rounds interactive communication protocol consists of mappings {f ij | j ∈ M, 1 ≤ i ≤ r}, where f ij de- notes the communication sent by the jth node in the ith round of the protocol; speciﬁcally, f ij is a function of U j , X n j and the communication sent in the previous rounds {f kl | 1 ≤ k ≤ i − 1, l ∈ M}. Denote the rv corresponding to the communication by F = (F 11 , . . . , F 1m , . . . , F r1 , . . . , F rm ). Note that F = F (n) (U M , X n M ). For r = 1, we call the protocol noninteractive.\nThe interactive protocol above is executed by the central switch, which upon relaying the communication F 1M , . . . , F iM to all the nodes, receives the communication F (i+1)j from the jth node. Note that here all m terminals are assumed to communicate in each round of interaction. In Section III, we will consider adaptive protocols in a scenario where some of the terminals may drop out, leaving only a subset A i ⊆ M to communicate in round i.\nDeﬁnition 2. Given 0 ≤ < 1, for some n ≥ 1, an rv K = K (n) (U M , X n M ), taking values in a ﬁnite set K, is an\n-secret key ( -SK), achievable from observations of length n, using randomization U M , and -recoverable from r-rounds interactive communication F = F (n) (U M , X n M ) if\n(i) it satisﬁes the \u201cstrong\u201d secrecy condition: log |K| − H(K) + I(K ∧ F) < ; and\n(ii) it is -recoverable from (F, U i , X n i ), for all i ∈ M. The rate of this -SK is given by 1 n log |K|.\nA rate R ≥ 0 is an achievable SK rate if for every 0 < < 1, there exists an -SK of rate greater than R − . The SK\ncapacity C(M) is deﬁned as the supremum of all achievable SK rates. A 0-SK K is referred to as a perfect SK, and the supremum over the rates of a 0-SK is the perfect SK capacity C 0 (M).\nTheorem 1 (Csisz´ar-Narayan [3]). The SK capacity is given by\n(2) The quantity R CO above denotes the minimum rate of\ncommunication for \u201comniscience\u201d [3], i.e., the minimum achievable rate of interactive communication F such that X n M is -recoverable from (F, U i , X n i ), for all i ∈ M. We further note from [3] that there exists a noninteractive communication of rate R CO that attains omniscience at M .\nIn this section, a new fault-tolerant version of the SK gener- ation problem is formulated. We consider adaptive protocols\nthat take into account the dropping out of nodes during the protocol. It is required that the nodes that remain at the end of a protocol agree upon an SK.\nThe adaptive protocol is executed by the central switch. Let A 1 denote the set of nodes that communicate in round 1, the rest of the nodes having dropped out without communicating. Knowing the set A 1 , the central switch then provides the nodes in A 1 with all the round-1 communication, and anticipates the next round of communication from them. However, only the nodes in a subset A 2 of A 1 communicate in round 2. This process is repeated for r rounds, with only the nodes in A r remaining in the rth round. Clearly we have A r ⊆ A r−1 ⊆ . . . ⊆ A 1 ⊆ M. Note that in a given round of communication, each remaining node has access to the communication that was sent in the previous rounds. As in Deﬁnition 1, for r = 1, we call the protocol noninteractive.\nIn this paper, we assume that for r ≥ 2, A r = A r−1 , i.e., for adaptive protocols, the nodes remaining in the (r − 1)th round are required to communicate in the rth round, or else the protocol fails. (The case of r = 1 is handled separately.) Thus, except when r ≥ 2 and i = r, the set of nodes that will communicate in round i is not known to the central switch at the end of the previous round. In the exceptional case, the assumption A r = A r−1 ensures that the set of nodes that will communicate in the rth round is known a priori. In practice, this could be implemented by having the central switch announce to all nodes at the beginning of the rth round that this is the ﬁnal round of communication. If all nodes in A r−1 respond, the protocol completes; otherwise it fails.\nUsing the adaptive protocol above, the nodes generate an SK for the remaining set, A r , of nodes. We do not require that the SK be concealed from the nodes in M \\ A r . Fixing the maximum number of nodes that may drop out during the protocol as t, the SK rate guaranteed by the protocol corre- sponds to the worst-case rate of an SK that is generated by the remaining nodes in A r , for all choices of sets A r ⊆ · · · ⊆ A 1 with |A r | = |A r−1 | ≥ m − t.\nDeﬁnition 3. For r ≥ 1, and n ≥ 1, an r-rounds adap- tive protocol, for each A = {A l : 1 ≤ l ≤ r − 1}, with A r−1 ⊆ A r−2 ⊆ . . . ⊆ A 1 ⊆ M, consists of mappings {f ij | j ∈ A i−1 , 1 ≤ i ≤ r} , where A 0 = M. For each j ∈ A i−1 , f ij is a function of U j , X n j and the communication from all the previous rounds, {f kl | 1 ≤ k ≤ i − 1, l ∈ A k }.\nHere f ij denotes the communication from the jth node in the ith round of communication, and so, is deﬁned only for the nodes j ∈ A i−1 , where A i−1 is the set of nodes that remain after the (i − 1)th round. The function f ij depends on the sequence of sets A i−1 ⊆ ... ⊆ A 1 ⊆ A 0 = M.\nWith a slight abuse of notation, let F = F A denote the random value of the communication corresponding to the decreasing family of subsets A.\nIt is perhaps worth clarifying that f ij in the deﬁnition above is what j ∈ A i−1 prepares to communicate in the ith round; it may happen that j drops out before actually sending this\ncommunication. For r ≥ 2, the nodes remaining at the end of (r − 1)th round must communicate in the rth round, or else the protocol fails.\nDeﬁnition 4. For 1 ≤ t ≤ m and r ≥ 2, a rate R ≥ 0 is said to be an achievable (r, t)-fault-tolerant SK rate, if for every 0 <\n< 1, there exists n ≥ 1, and an r-rounds adaptive protocol as above, such that for every decreasing family A, with |A r−1 | ≥ m − t, there exists an -SK K = K (n) U A r−1 , X n A r−1 , of rate greater than R − , that\n(i) satisﬁes the \u201cstrong\u201d secrecy condition: log |K|−H(K)+ I (K ∧ F) < ; and\n(ii) is -recoverable from (F, U i , X n i ), for all i ∈ A r−1 ; we say that K is an -SK for A r−1 recoverable from the protocol.\nNote that a rate R is achievable if every remaining subset A r−1 of size m − t or more can form an SK of rate R, irrespective of A. The actual SK K, however, may depend on A.\nSimilarly, R ≥ 0 is an achievable (1, t)-fault-tolerant SK rate if for every 0 < \t < 1, there exists n ≥ 1, and a noninteractive (1-round adaptive) protocol, such that for every A ⊂ M, with |A| ≥ m − t, there exists an - SK K = K (n) (U A , X n A ), of rate greater than R − , that satisﬁes (i) and (ii) above. The (r, t)-fault-tolerant SK capacity C r,t (M) is deﬁned as the supremum of all (r, t)-fault-tolerant SK rates.\nThe (r, t)-fault-tolerant perfect SK capacity C r,t 0 (M) is deﬁned analogously.\nSince any r-rounds adaptive protocol can be implemented in r + 1 rounds by choosing f 1j = ∅, and deﬁning the last r rounds of communication f ij , 2 ≤ i ≤ r +1 as in the r-rounds protocol, we have from their deﬁnitions that various notions of fault-tolerant capacity are related as below:\nNext, given A ⊆ M, consider the family A 1 = ... = A r−1 = A r = A. This family corresponds to the case where the nodes j that communicate during the protocol never drop- out. Therefore, the rate R of an SK that a fault-tolerant protocol generates for this family can not exceed the SK capacity for A, C(A) (see Deﬁnition 2). Here C(A) is deﬁned as in (1), with constraints in (2) now applied for all B A 1 . Thus, if R is an achievable (r, t)-fault-tolerant SK rate, then for any subset A of M, with |A| ≥ m − t, it holds that\nwith |A| = m − t in the upper bound above. Lemma 2 (Monotonicity of SK capacity).\nThe proof is based on an alternative expression for C(M) derived in [1], and is omitted due to space constraints. We summarize the observations above in the following Lemma.\nLemma 3. For r ≥ 1, the (r, t)-fault-tolerant SK capacity satisﬁes the following:\nThe fault-tolerant SK capacity represents the optimal worst- case rate of an SK. A much stronger optimality criterion given below requires the protocol to generate an optimum rate SK for each remaining subset of nodes.\nDeﬁnition 5. For r ≥ 2 and n ≥ 1, we say that an r- rounds adaptive protocol is strongly optimal for fault-tolerant SK generation if for every decreasing family A, consisting of A r−1 ⊆ . . . ⊆ A 1 , and for every 0 < < 1, there exists an - SK K for A r−1 , recoverable from the protocol, of rate greater than C (A r−1 ) − . A similar deﬁnition holds for adaptive protocols with r = 1.\nIn applications like mobile communication, it is required that all the nodes have a symmetric role in the SK generation protocol. In fact, it is often the case that the underlying source model is also symmetric. In the remainder of this paper, we will focus on such symmetric models for fault-tolerant SK generation. We are now in a position to state our main results.\nWe ﬁrst consider a symmetric source model consist- ing of exchangeable rvs X 1 , . . . , X m , i.e., P X 1 ,...,X m = P X σ(1) ,...,X σ(m) , for all permutations σ of {1, . . . , m}. Then, for A ⊆ M, H X A |X M\\A depends only on the size of A; for 1 ≤ i, j < m and i + j ≤ m, denote by g(i|j) the conditional entropy H (X 1 , . . . , X i |X i+1 , . . . , X i+j ), with the convention g(m|0) = H (X M ) and g(0|m) = 0. We characterize next the minimum rate of communication for omniscience R CO for exchangeable rvs.\nα m = g(m − 1|1) m − 1\nAs noted in the discussion following Theorem 1, the opti- mum rate communication for omniscience can be noninterac- tive. The lemma above implies that it is possible to attain omniscience using noninteractive communication of equal rates from each node. The next lemma shows that this equal rate of transmission decreases with the number of nodes.\nThe proofs of Lemmas 4 and 5 are based on elementary properties of the conditional entropies g(i|j) and are omitted due to space constraints.\nUsing these observations, the following theorem character- izes the (r, t)-fault-tolerant SK capacity for exchangeable rvs, when r ≥ 2.\nTheorem 6. For 1 ≤ t ≤ m and r ≥ 2, the (r, t)-fault-tolerant SK capacity is given by\nFurthermore, there exists a 2-rounds adaptive protocol that is strongly optimal.\nProof . We ﬁrst note from Lemma 3, Theorem 1, and Lemma 4 that C r,t (M) ≤ g(m − t|0) − (m − t)α m−t .\nWe next show that C 2,t (M) ≥ g(m − t|0) − (m − t)α m−t . Fix 0 < < 1. Assume, for now (we will prove this later), that for sufﬁciently large n, there exists a 2-rounds adaptive protocol with the following properties:\n(ii) for A ⊆ M, with k = |A|, let f 2j = f k 2j , where f k 2j : X n j → 1, . . . , 2 n(α k −α m ) , for all j ∈ A; denote its random value by F k 2j ,\n(iii) for each A ⊆ M, X n A is -recoverable from X n l , F 1j , F k 2j , j ∈ A , for all l ∈ A.\nNote that if only the nodes in a subset A with |A| = k re- main after the ﬁrst round, the overall rate of communication for the protocol is kα k . Using a version of the Balanced Coloring Lemma [3, Lemma B.3], for sufﬁciently large n, there exists an rv K = K (X n A ) of rate greater than H (X A ) − kα k −\nwith I K ∧ F 1j , F k 2j , j ∈ A ≤ . The nodes ﬁrst use the protocol above to recover X n A , and then compute the SK K = K (X n A ). It follows from Lemma 4 and Theorem 1 that C(A) = H (X A ) − kα k , which establishes the strong optimality of the protocol above. Furthermore, from Lemma 2, if k ≥ m − t, then C(A) ≥ g(m − t|0) − (m − t)α m−t . Thus, the proof of the theorem would be complete once we show the existence of the protocol above.\nTo that end, from Lemma 4 and [2, Lemma 13.13], for sufﬁciently large n, random mappings F j , j ∈ A, of rate α k result in omniscience at the terminals in A. In fact, the same result holds if F j is replaced by two independent random mappings of rates that sum to α k . Speciﬁcally, consider random mappings F 1j of X n j of rate α m for j ∈ M. For k ≤ m, for 1 ≤ j ≤ k, let F k 2j be random mappings of rate α k − α m . Note that from Lemma 5 we have α k − α m ≥ 0. Therefore, from the discussion above, the random mappings F 1j , j ∈ M, and F k 2j , 1 ≤ j ≤ k, constitute a protocol with the required properties, with probability close to 1 for n sufﬁciently large.\nRemark. It remains unresolved whether the inequality C 1,t (M) ≤ C 2,t (M) is strict or not for the exchangeable source model studied here.\nIn this section, we consider fault-tolerant SK generation for a special case of the multiterminal source model, namely, the PIN model (see [5], [6]). The PIN model is speciﬁed by a graph G = (V, E ), with vertex set V = M and edge set E . For n ≥ 1, let G (n) be the multigraph with vertex set V = M and edge set E (n) containing n copies of each edge of G. The n copies of an edge e = {i, j} ∈ E represent n i.i.d. copies of an unbiased random bit B e available to the nodes i and j. For each e ∈ E, the rv B n e is jointly independent of the rvs (B n e , e ∈ E \\ {e}). Consequently, for each i ∈ M, the observations of the ith node are given by the rv\nAs before, X M = (X 1 , . . . , X m ) and X n M = (X n 1 , . . . , X n m ). For this PIN model, an interactive communication protocol\nwas given in [5], [6] to generate a 1-bit perfect SK from X M , when G is a spanning tree for the vertices in M. Here, we present a new fault-tolerant variant of that protocol. In particular, our protocol below yields a 1-bit (1, t)-fault-tolerant perfect SK for a PIN model consisting of a (t + 1)-connected spanning graph G (we say that a graph G is (t + 1)-connected if the subgraph G(A) induced by G on the vertices in A ⊆ M is connected whenever |A| ≥ m − t).\nFor A ⊆ M, |A| ≥ m − t, let e A be an edge in G(A); such an edge exists as G is (t + 1)-connected.\nClaim: For each i ∈ A, B e A is a function of (F A , X i ), and I (B e A ∧ F A ) = 0. Thus, B e A is a 1-bit perfect SK achievable from X A .\nProof. Since G is (t + 1)-connected, and |A| ≥ m − t, for each i ∈ A and for some edge e l incident on i, there exists a path {e A , e 1 , . . . , e l } in G(A). Since e l is incident on i, B e l is a function of X i . Further, note that the communication F A includes the rvs B e A ⊕ B e 1 , B e 1 ⊕ B e 2 , . . . , B e l−1 ⊕ B e l . Therefore, B e A = (B e A ⊕B e 1 ) ⊕ (B e 1 ⊕B e 2 ) ⊕ . . . ⊕ (B e l−1 ⊕ B e l ) ⊕ B e l is a function of (F A , X i ).\nLabelling the rest of the edges so that E = {e 0 = e A , e 1 , . . . , e k }, we have\nThe equality above follows from the fact that for all i, j, we have B e i ⊕ B e j = (B e 0 ⊕ B e i ) ⊕ (B e 0 ⊕ B e j ). Similarly,\nH B e i ⊕ B e j , 0 ≤ i, j ≤ k | B e A = H (B e 1 , . . . , B e k | B e 0 ) = k, \t (4)\nwhere the last equality follows from the pairwise independence assumption. Hence,\nFor the remainder of this section we take G to be K m , i.e., the complete graph on m vertices. This is the unique choice of G for which the rvs X 1 , . . . , X m are exchangeable. For this symmetric model, the theorem below shows the strong optimality (see Deﬁnition 5) of Protocol 1, when it is applied to a certain packing of spanning trees.\nTheorem 7. For the PIN model speciﬁed by the complete graph K m , we have\nFurthermore, there exists a strongly optimal protocol for fault- tolerant SK generation.\nProof. For i ∈ M, denote by Y i the \u201cstar-shaped\u201d spanning tree with edge set given by E i = {{i, j} : j ∈ M, j = i}. Then, for any subset A ⊆ M, the union of i∈A Y i (A) is precisely the multigraph, K (2) A , on the vertex set A with two edges between each pair of distinct vertices. Therefore, if the nodes in a subset A of M remain, we can use Protocol 1 to generate a 1-bit perfect SK bit for each Y i (A), i ∈ A. This yields a perfect SK of size |A| bits achievable from the observations X 2 A = (X 2 i , i ∈ A). The rate of this SK is |A|/2. Thus, for 0 ≤ t ≤ m, (m − t)/2 is an achievable (1, t)-fault- tolerant perfect SK rate.\nfor A ⊆ M, |A| = m − t. Thus the converse will follow upon showing that C(A) = (m − t)/2, when |A| = m − t. In fact, if C(A) = (m − t)/2 holds, then the protocol is strongly optimal. To that end, since the rvs X 1 , . . . , X m are exchangeable, a straightforward computation using Theorem 1 and Lemma 4 yields C(A) = m−t 2 .\nThe rate-optimal protocol above is noninteractive and does not require local randomness. However, it does need obser- vations of length n = 2. We next propose a fault-tolerant perfect SK generation protocol that works with observations of length n = 1, is noninteractive, and generates m/2 − t bits of SK when upto t nodes leave. Speciﬁcally, for K m , our result below gives a spanning tree packing of size m/2 , i.e., a collection of m/2 disjoint 2 spanning trees of K m , such that every vertex is a leaf for all but one of the spanning trees in the packing. The SK generation protocol then involves using Protocol 1 on each of these disjoint spanning trees. Removing a vertex only disconnects those spanning trees for which the vertex is not a leaf. Consequently, upon removing t vertices, the remaining graph still contains m/2 − t disjoint spanning trees. Hence, when up to t nodes leave, the remaining nodes generate m/2 − t bits of SK.\nLemma 8. K m contains a spanning tree packing of size m/2 , such that every vertex is a leaf for all but one of\nProof. We give a construction for even m. For odd m, the proof can be completed by introducing a dummy node, carrying out the construction for K m+1 , and ﬁnally deleting the dummy node.\nFor m = 2k, consider a perfect matching in K m . It partitions the vertices into two disjoint sets {u 1 , . . . , u k } and {v 1 , . . . , v k }, and consists of edges {u i , v i } for 1 ≤ i ≤ k. For each edge {u i , v i } of the match- ing, consider the spanning tree T i , whose edge set is the union of {{u i , u j }, i < j ≤ k}, {{u i , v j }, 1 ≤ j ≤ i}, {{v i , v j }, i < j ≤ k}, and {{v i , u j }, 1 ≤ j < i}, as depicted in Fig. 1. It is clear that the edge-disjoint spanning trees T i , i = 1, . . . , k, satisfy the properties claimed above.\nThe adaptive protocols considered in this paper are ad- mittedly a ﬁrst step towards the larger goal of information- theoretic SK agreement for dynamic groups. The next step is to allow rejoining of terminals that drop out, and more generally, to handle arbitrary dropping in-and-out of the m terminals. We also intend to consider stronger adversarial models.\nThe authors thank Amitabh Saxena and Andrew Thangaraj for useful discussions leading up to this work.
