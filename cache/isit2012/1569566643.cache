In Section V, numerical results are provided, and some conclusions are drawn in Section VI.\nWe consider a three-node communication system compris- ing a source S, a half-duplex relay R, and a destination D. The relay is equipped with a buffer of unlimited size. The source sends messages to the destination directly or with the help of the half-duplex relay, which decodes these messages, possibly stores some information about the message in its buffer, and eventually sends this information to the destination. We assume that time is divided into slots of equal lengths and that every message sent by the source and relay is encoded by a capacity approaching code with codewords comprised of n symbols, where n → ∞. The instantaneous link SNRs of the S-D, S-R, and R-D channels in the ith time slot are denoted by x(i), y(i), and z(i), respectively. We assume that the link SNRs are constant during one time slot but change from one time slot to the next due to e.g. the mobility of the involved nodes and/or frequency hopping. The instantaneous SNRs x(i), y(i), and z(i) are modeled as mutually independent, non-negative, and ergodic random processes with expected values Ω X = E{x(i)}, Ω Y = E{y(i)}, and Ω Z = E{z(i)}, respectively, where E{·} denotes expectation. The instanta- neous link SNRs x(i), y(i), and z(i) can be decomposed as x(i) = γ S ¯ x(i), y(i) = γ S ¯ y(i), and z = γ R ¯ z(i), where γ S = P S /σ 2 n and γ R = P R /σ 2 n denote the transmit SNRs, with P S and P R representing the transmit powers of the source and the relay, respectively, and σ 2 n representing the variance of the additive white Gaussian noise at both relay and destination. ¯ x(i), ¯ y(i), and ¯ z(i) are the instantaneous channel gains of the S-D, S-R, and R-D channels, respectively, with means E{¯x} = ¯ Ω X , E{¯y} = ¯ Ω Y , and E{¯z} = ¯ Ω Z . Note that Ω X = γ S ¯ Ω X , Ω Y = γ S ¯ Ω Y , and Ω Z = γ R ¯ Ω Z .\nThroughout this paper, we assume that the codewords trans- mitted by the source and relay nodes have constant powers P S and P R in every time slot i. Furthermore, we assume that the source node has always data to transmit, and therefore the number of time slots N satisﬁes N → ∞.\nIn this section, we introduce the buffer-aided relaying pro- tocol with adaptive link selection for the considered system. In the following, we assume that all three nodes have knowledge of P S , P R , and σ 2 n .\nIn a given time slot i, all three nodes acquire knowledge of x(i), y(i), and z(i). Based on this knowledge, the three nodes make one of the following decisions:\n\u2022 if the relay is used, whether the relay should receive or transmit, that is, whether to select the S-R or R-D link for transmission.\nbuffer, maps them to a codeword and transmits the codeword to the destination through the R-D channel with capacity Z(i) = log 2 (1 + z(i)). In the following, we normalize the amount of information in bits that is extracted from the relay\u2019s buffer nW Q (i) by the number of symbols n. Therefore, W Q (i) is the normalized amount of information in bits/symbol that is extracted from the relay\u2019s buffer and is transmitted to the destination. W Q (i) is limited by two upper bounds. The ﬁrst bound is due to the total amount of normalized information in bits/symbol that the relay has stored in its buffer, which is given by Q(i − 1). The second bound is the maximum rate in bits/symbol at which the destination can decode assuming that source and relay cooperate and perform beamforming. This bound is given by\nW Q (i) = min {Q(i − 1) , W (i)} . \t (5) The codebook that source and relay use has 2 nW Q (i) code- words each with n symbols. We note that for source and relay to be able to perform beamforming in time slot i, the source has to track all past and current instantaneous SNRs x(k), y(k), and z(k), for k = 1, ..., i, in order to know the exact information bits that the relay transmits in time slot i.\nAt the end of the considered time slot i, the amount of normalized bits/symbol in the buffer is given by\nDecoding at the Destination: There are three possible cases: 1) If at time slot i the source sends a codeword directly\nto the destination without utilizing the relay ( r i = 0), then the destination can successfully decode the codeword sent at a rate of X(i) bits/symbol.\n2) If at time slot i the relay is utilized and the source transmits ( r 1 = 1, d i = 0), then the destination cannot decode the codeword sent at a rate of Y (i) bits/symbol. Therefore, it stores the received codeword and waits until some future time slot in which the relay reveals to the destination the partition number in which the stored codeword lies.\n3) If at time slot i the relay is utilized and the source and relay transmit a codeword via beamforming ( r i = d i = 1), then the destination can successfully decode the codeword sent at a rate of W Q (i) bits/symbol. The information that this codeword carries is comprised of the partition indices in which some stored codewords lie, and this information helps the destination to decode these previously undecodable codewords. To this end, the destination has to divide the nW Q (i) bits of information into groups of bits carrying information about the partition numbers of different stored codewords. Without loss of generality assume that nW Q (i) carries information about the partition indices of L stored codewords, for L ∈ {1, 2, ..., N}. Let these codewords be placed in a ordered set denoted by C, in which the codewords are sorted by the time slot in which they were received and stored at the destination, starting with the ﬁrst received codeword. Hence, set C can be written as C = {c 1 , c 2 , ..., c L }, where c k , k ∈ {1, 2, ..., L}, denotes the k-th codeword in the set. Using set C we can distinguish three cases for the\n1 N\n1 N\nwhere W (i) is deﬁned in (4). A queue is said to be absorbing if A > D, in which case a fraction of the bits sent by the source get absorbed in the buffer and can never be extracted from it. If a queue is non-absorbing, then by the law of conservation of ﬂow A = D holds. Therefore, a necessary condition for all bits transmitted by the source to be decoded at the destination, is for the queue in the buffer at the relay to be non-absorbing, i.e., A = D has to hold.\nTheorem 1: The throughput that the system achieves is given by τ = lim\n1 N\n1 N\nOur goal now is to maximize the throughput. To this end, we ﬁrst introduce the edge of stability point, which is the point where the queue is at the boundary between being a non- absorbing and an absorbing queue, and yet the queue is non- absorbing. This point can be rigorously deﬁned as follows: Let I 10 denote a set comprised of the slots in which r i = 1 and d i = 0, let ǫ contain arbitrary slots that are not in I 10 , and let A = D hold. The queue is at the edge of stability if adding the slots in ǫ to I 10 would make the queue absorbing, i.e., A > D holds, even for |ǫ|/N → 0 when N → ∞, where | · | denotes cardinality.\nTheorem 2: The maximum throughput is obtained when the queue in the buffer at the relay is at the edge of stability. In this case the following identity holds for N → ∞\n1 N\nWhen (11) holds for N → ∞, the throughput given by (10) simpliﬁes to\n1 N\nProof: Due to lack of space we only present a sketch of the proof in Appendix B. For the full proof, please refer to [9].\nNote that the throughput in (12) is now independent of the queue state. This is because when the relay is selected to transmit, the number of bits in the buffer practically always exceeds the number of bits that can be transmitted over the R-D channel. The event that the relay is selected to transmit when its buffer is empty has negligible effect on the throughput for N → ∞.\nAccording to Theorem 2, the policy that maximizes the throughput can only be found inside the set of policies that produce a queue which is at the edge of stability, and not\n(1 − r i )X(i) + N i=1 r i (1 − d i )Y (i) Subject to : C1 : 1 N N i=1 r i (1 − d i ) Y (i) − X(i)\n    \n   \nThen, E{r(1 − d)Y } and E{r(1 − d)(Y − X)} are found by inserting G = Y and G = Y − X in (18), respectively, and E{rd} and E{rdW } are found by inserting B = 1 and B = W in (19), respectively, where X, Y , and W are given by (1), (2), and (4), respectively.\nProof: Due to lack of space, we omit the proof here. For the proof, please refer to [9].\nRemark 1: The optimal value of γ S can be found by searching in the domain 0 < γ S ≤ Γ so that (15) is maximized while (16) and (17) jointly hold.\nIn this section, we assume Rayleigh fading. We compare the ergodic rate of buffer-aided relaying given by (15), to the unachievable upper bound on the ergodic capacity introduced in [3] for the case when the relay always alternates between reception and transmission in successive time slots, which we refer to as conventional relaying in the following. This bound is given by\nWe note that this unachievable upper bound is obtained assum- ing that when the source transmits, the relay and destination operate as a single node with two antennas. Furthermore, this bound is optimized over three parameters, the slot length dedicated to relay listening denoted by t, the fraction of power dedicated to the source denoted by k, and the fraction of new information that the source transmits when the relay is in the transmit mode, denoted by ξ.\nFig. 1 shows the ratio between the achievable rate τ of buffer-aided relaying and C + conv as a function of Γ. The ﬁgure illustrates that buffer-aided relaying achieves a large gain over conventional relaying when the direct S-D link is weak compared to the S-R and R-D links. Furthermore, buffer- aided relaying outperforms conventional relaying for low to moderate Γ even if the direct S-D link is strong. However, when ¯ Ω X > 0 and Γ → ∞, then τ/C + conv < 1, which is due to the fact that the assumption in C + conv is that the relay and the destination act as a single node with two antennas, while the variability of the S-R and R-D channel capacities due to fading vanishes. Therefore, without the variability of\n1 N\n1 N\nthe relay is selected to transmit and the buffer is empty has negligible effect on the throughput for N → ∞ [4]. As a result, for N → ∞ the third sum in (10) can be written as\n1 N\nLet τ o denote the throughput when the queue is at the edge of stability. At this point, let I 0 denote the set of slots in which r i = 0, let I 10 denote the set of slots in which r i = 1 and d i = 0, and let I 11 denote the set of slots in which r i = 1 and d i = 1. From (10) the throughout τ o using (23) and the sets I 0 , I 10 , and I 11 can be written as\nTo prove that τ 0 cannot be improved, we construct all other possible policies which dislocate the queue from the edge of stability and compare the achieved throughput to τ 0 . These policies make the events in which Q(i − 1) < W (i) non- negligible in the throughput equation, i.e., (23) does not hold. The only way for a policy to dislocate the queue from the edge of stability and yet keep the buffer non-absorbing is to increase the number of slots in I 11 . Thus, lets pick arbitrary slots that are not in the set I 11 and put them in the set ǫ. Then let I 11 ∪ ǫ denote a set in which the slots in ǫ are added to the slots in I 11 . Note that N = |I 0 | + |I 10 | + |I 11 |. Thus, if the slots in ǫ are added to I 11 then these slots must be excluded from either the set I 0 , or I 10 , or from both I 0 and I 10 . Therefore, there exist only three groups of other possible policies.\nThe remainder of the proof is to derive the throughputs for each of the three groups of possible policies, and then compare these throughputs to τ 0 . What we see then is that none of the other policies can outperform the policy that produces τ 0 . However, due to lack of space this is omitted here.
