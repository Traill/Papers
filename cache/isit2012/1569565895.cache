This is a simple extension of the result of Hirota and Ikehara [1]. Applying the necessary and sufﬁcient conditions, a closed-form expression of the minimax strategy for binary pure state signal is shown. Furthermore, the minimax strategy for a discrimination problem of the quasi-Bell states is considered. In this case, the square-root measurement consisting of the quasi-Bell states yields the minimax strategy."},"body":{"text":"The statistical decision theory of quantum system has been extensively discussed since the pioneering works by Helstrom [2], Yuen et al. [3], [4] and Holevo [5]. It treats the problems of optimal measurement of quantum states, using an appropriate quality function such as the average probability of decision error. Suppose that there are a ﬁnite number of quantum states. In many of the cases investigated so far, one takes a scenario that the receiver knows the probability distribution of the quantum states and the average probability of decision error is used as a quality function. From the point of view of the statistical decision theory, the minimization problem of the average probability of decision error is a special case of the minimization problem of the average Bayes cost. An optimal decision rule that minimizes the average Bayes cost under the assumption that the receiver knows the probability distribution of the states is called the Bayes strategy. For the Bayes strat- egy, Holevo derived the necessary and sufﬁcient conditions by considering inﬁnitesimal transformations of the detection operators [5]. On the other hand, Yuen et al. had remarked this type of problems can be solved by using the principle of duality in vector space optimization [3], [4]. To this end, Holevo proved the duality relation for the Bayes strategy [6]. Eldar et al. also showed that a semideﬁnite programming method is valid for deriving the necessary and sufﬁcient conditions; moreover, they developed an efﬁcient numerical computation algorithm for ﬁnding the optimal measurement, based on the duality argument [7]. Although it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd an explicit form of the Bayes strategy in general, many closed-form expressions of the Bayes strategy have been shown ([8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], etc.), using the necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for the Bayes strategy. Thus the Bayes strategy in quantum signal detection has been\nwell-developed and the necessary and sufﬁcient conditions play a central role in such studies.\nHere we take another scenario that the receiver does not know the probability distribution of the states. In this scenario, one can apply the so-called minimax strategy. With this approach, D\u2019Ariano et al. showed some basic properties of minimax discrimination [16] and discussed its application to the discrimination problem of two Pauli channels [17]. Hirota and Ikehara attempted to derive the necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for the minimax strategy in the case that the average probability of decision error is used as a quality function [1]. However the set of the conditions shown in the reference [1] works only when every resulting \u2018minimax\u2019 probability is strictly positive. Therefore the aim of this paper is to derive the necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for the minimax strategy in a general form.\nSuppose that there are M hypotheses about states of a quantum system and the ith hypothesis H i is the proposition that the system is in the state ˆρ i , where ˆρ i is a density operator on Hilbert space H, that is, ˆρ i ≥ 0 and Trˆρ i = 1. The prior probability of hypothesis H i is denoted by p i . We let\nbe a positive operator-valued measure consisting of M detec- tion operators, where\nand ˆ 1 is the identity operator on H. Then the conditional probability that the receiver chooses H j when H i is true is given by P (j|i) = Trˆρ i ˆ Π j . The cost incurred by choosing H j when H i is true is denoted by B ji , which is a non- negative number. In general, B ji > B ii if i = j. Letting P (i, j) = p i Tr ˆ Π j ˆρ i , the expected value of the costs is given by\nwhere p = (p 1 , p 2 , . . . , p M ). Deﬁning the risk operators by ˆ W i = M\nthis average Bayes cost is rewritten as ¯ B(Π, p) = Tr M\nThen the Bayes problem in quantum signal detection is ex- pressed as follows:\nthe set of all decision rules consisting of M decision operators. For this problem, it has been proved [5] that there exists an optimal decision rule Π bayes such that\nThis decision rule Π bayes is called the Bayes strategy, and the necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for the Bayes strategy are given as follows [5] (See also [6], [7]): A decision rule Π bayes = ( ˆ Π bayes 1 , ˆ Π bayes 2 . . . , ˆ Π bayes M ) is the Bayes strategy at p if and only if\nˆ Π bayes i ( ˆ W i − ˆ W j ) ˆ Π bayes j \t = 0 ∀(i, j), \t (9) ˆ W i − ˆ Υ bayes ≥ 0 ∀i, \t (10)\nAt that time, the minimum average Bayes cost at p is ¯ B min (p) = min\nTake two probability vectors p and p in P. Letting p = tp + (1 − t)p with parameter 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, we obtain\nFrom this point, we move our attention to the minimax problem in quantum signal detection. We assume that the true probability distribution of the M quantum states is unknown. Under this assumption, we consider the following optimization problem.\nRecall that the set P is a bounded and closed convex set, and the set D is a convex compact set [5]. For ﬁxed p,\nThus, the average Bayes cost is afﬁne for p and for Π, respectively. Moreover, since the mapping from D to the set of all the channel matrices, {(P (j|i))} = {(Tr ˆ Π j ˆρ i )}, is an afﬁne continuous mapping [5], ¯ B(Π, p) can be regarded as a continuous convex function of Π for ﬁxed p. At the same time, it can also be regarded as a continuous concave function of p for ﬁxed Π. By virtue of the minimax theorem in convex analysis [18], we obtain the next lemma:\nIn what follows we call Π ◦ the minimax strategy, p ◦ the minimax distribution, and ¯ B ◦ the minimax value. Note that p ◦ is not necessary to be identical to the true distribution.\nIn the previous section we have seen the existence of the minimax strategy and the minimax distribution. Our next task is to characterize such solutions by its necessary and sufﬁcient conditions, like in the case of the Bayes strategy.\nLet p ◦ be an optimal distribution and Π ◦ an optimal decision rule in terms of minimax strategy. Since\nmin Π∈D ¯ B(Π, p ◦ ) = ¯ B min (p ◦ ), \t (19) Π ◦ is the Bayes strategy at p ◦ . Hence the conditions (9) and (10) must be satisﬁed. On the other hand, we have\nSince ¯ B min (p) is concave, the distribution p ◦ is optimal if and only if the conditions\nhold for some constant λ [19]. Multiplying Eq. (21) by p ◦ i , and summing over i, we obtain\nTheorem 2: Necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for the minimax distribution and minimax strategy are\nˆ Π ◦ i ( ˆ W ◦ i − ˆ W ◦ j ) ˆ Π ◦ j = 0 ∀(i, j), \t (24) ˆ W ◦ i − ˆ Υ ◦ ≥ 0 ∀i, \t (25)\nCorollary: Let B ji = 1 − δ ji , where δ ji is the Kronecker delta. Then the average Bayes cost becomes the average prob- ability of decision error, ¯ P e (p, Π). In this case, the conditions (24)-(27) are simpliﬁed to\nˆ Π ◦ i (p ◦ i ˆρ i − p ◦ j ˆρ j ) ˆ Π ◦ j = 0 ∀(i, j), \t (29) ˆ Γ ◦ − p ◦ i ˆρ i ≥ 0 ∀i, \t (30)\nTr ˆ Π ◦ i ˆρ i = Tr ˆ Γ ◦ ∀i s.t. p ◦ i > 0, (31) Tr ˆ Π ◦ i ˆρ i ≥ Tr ˆ Γ ◦ ∀i s.t. p ◦ i = 0, (32)\nLet q = (q 1 , q 2 , . . . , q M ) denote the true probability dis- tribution of the states, and recall that we have assumed that the receiver does not know q. As mentioned in the end of the previous section, the minimax distribution p ◦ is not necessary to be identical to the true distribution q. If p ◦ = q, then we have ¯ B(Π ◦ , q) = ¯ B min (q). That is, the minimax strategy is the best decision rule in this case. However, if there is a mismatch between p ◦ and q, the receiver has to pay the penalty ¯ B(Π ◦ , q)− ¯ B min (q) as far as the minimax strategy Π ◦ is used. But such a penalty has an upper bound. The following lemma tells that the minimax value is an upper bound of the penalty.\nLemma 3: Let Π ◦ = { ˆ Π ◦ 1 , ˆ Π ◦ 2 , . . . , ˆ Π ◦ M } be the minimax strategy , and let p ◦ = (p ◦ 1 , p ◦ 2 , . . . , p ◦ M ) be the minimax distribution. Then we obtain\nThus, the average Bayes cost of the minimax strategy never exceeds the minimax value ¯ B ◦ even if the minimax distribution p ◦ is not equal to the true probability distribution q. Moreover, it is immediate from Eq.(34) that ¯ B(Π ◦ , q) − ¯\nLet us consider the discrimination problem between non- orthogonal pure states ˆρ 1 = |ψ 1 ψ 1 | and ˆρ 2 = |ψ 2 ψ 2 | such that ψ 1 |ψ 2 = κe iθ , where 0 < κ < 1, 0 ≤ θ < 2π and i = √\n−1. Then the average Bayes cost is written in the following form.\nIn this case, we can obtain the minimum average Bayes cost and its optimal detection operators by solving the eigenvalue problem of ˆρ 2 − ζ ˆρ 1 , where ζ = (p 1 B α )/(p 2 B β ) [2], [20].\nIf p = (1, 0), then the Bayes strategy is the so-called Kennedy receiver [21] given by ˆ Π bayes 1 \t = ˆρ 1 and ˆ Π bayes 2 \t = ˆ1 − ˆρ\n1 , and the minimum average Bayes cost is ¯ B min (1, 0) = B 11 . Similarly, if p = (0, 1), then ˆ Π bayes 1 = ˆ1 − ˆρ 2 and ˆ\nIf 0 < p 1 < 1, then the Bayes strategy at p = (p 1 , p 2 ) is given by\nwith the square-root measurement [8], [22], [23] |μ 1 = r 11 |ψ 1 + r 21 |ψ 2 ,\nwhere ∗ stands for the complex conjugate and Λ = (1 + ζ) 2 − 4ζκ 2 . In this case, the conditional probabilities\nα = 1 2 − (1 + ζ) − 2κ 2 2Λ , \t (43) β = 1 2 − (1 + ζ) − 2ζκ 2 2Λ \t . \t (44)\n¯ B min (p) = p 1 B 11 + p 2 B 22 + p 1 B α 2 + p 2 B β 2 \t (45) − 1 2 (p 1 B α + p 2 B β ) 2 − 4p 1 p 2 B α B β κ 2 .\nUsing the necessary and sufﬁcient conditions (24)-(27), we can obtain the following solutions to the binary pure-state minimax problem.\nCase 1: In the case of B 11 = B 22 , it is found that 0 < p ◦ 1 < 1. Hence by the condition (26), the minimax distribution is given by\nF 1 = B 2 β − B α B β (1 − 2κ 2 ), F 2 = B 2 α − B α B β (1 − 2κ 2 ),\nX = B 2 α + B 2 β − 2B α B β (1 − 2κ 2 ), Y = (B β − B α ) B α B β (1 − κ 2 ).\nSubstituting this minimax distribution into Eqs.(38)-(42), we can obtain the minimax strategy. At that time, the parameters u ◦ ij are given by\nα (F 1 B α B β − Y ), L = B β (F 2 B α B β + Y ),\nand ¯ B(Π ◦ , p) = ¯ B ◦ by Lemma 3. Particularly, if B 21 = B 12 , the result is simpliﬁed to\n2 \t , (51) and the minimax strategy is given by the square-root measure- ment of Eq. (39).\nCase 2a: Suppose that B 11 > B 22 . If κ > B 11 − B 22 B\nthen 0 < p ◦ 1 < 1. From the condition (26), the minimax distribution is given by\nY Δ = (B β − B α − 2Δ)B α B β κ √ 1 − κ 2 , Z Δ = (B β − B α )Δ − Δ 2 + B α B β κ 2 ,\nMoreover, the minimax strategy is given by the following parameters.\n(55) where\nK Δ = B α (F 1 Z Δ − Y Δ ), L Δ = B β (F 2 Z Δ + Y Δ ),\nCase 2b: Suppose that B 11 > B 22 . If κ ≤ B 11 − B 22 B\nthen p ◦ 1 = 1, p ◦ 2 = 0, ˆ Π ◦ 1 = ˆρ 1 , ˆ Π ◦ 2 = ˆ1 − ˆρ 1 , and ¯ B ◦ = B 11 . It is easy to verify that the solution (Π ◦ , p ◦ ) satisﬁes the conditions (26) and (27). Since ˆ Υ ◦ = B 11 ˆρ 1 , we obtain Tr ˆ Υ ◦ = B 11 . For i = 1, the left-hand side of Eq. (26) is equal to B 11 . For i = 2, the left-hand side of Eq. (27) is B 22 +B β κ 2 . Since κ satisﬁes the condition (58) and 0 < κ < 1, we obtain B 22 +B β κ 2 ≤ B 11 . Using the solution, the average Bayes cost by the minimax strategy at an arbitrary probability distribution p is\nCase 3a: Suppose that B 11 < B 22 . If κ > B 22 − B 11 B\nthen the minimax distribution, the optimal parameters for the minimax strategy, and the minimax value are given by Eqs. (53) (55), and (57), respectively.\nCase 3b: Suppose that B 11 < B 22 . If κ ≤ B 22 − B 11 B\nthen p ◦ 1 = 0, p ◦ 2 = 1, ˆ Π ◦ 1 = ˆ1 − ˆρ 2 , ˆ Π ◦ 2 = ˆρ 2 , and ¯ B ◦ = B 22 . The average Bayes cost by the minimax strategy is\nVarious types of the set of quantum states have been in- vestigated in the context of the minimum-error discrimination problem so far. Especially, it is found that, if the set of quantum states has a certain symmetry, the optimal decision rule that minimizes the average probability of decision er- ror at the uniform distribution is given by the square-root measurement; e.g., \u2018equidiagonal\u2019 cases of the set of pure states [8], \u2018symmetric quantum states\u2019 [9] and its extension [10], \u2018geometrically uniform (pure/mixed) states\u2019 [11], [12], \u2018doubly symmetric mixed states\u2019 [13], a pure state case of \u2018 Z N -symmetric states\u2019 [14], linear codeword states [15], and so on. In each of such cases, the square-root measurement satisﬁes not only the conditions (29) and (30), also the condition (31). Therefore, in those symmetric cases treated in the references listed above, the minimax strategy is the square-root measurement, and the minimax distribution is the uniform distribution.\nHere we add a new example to the list of the examples in which the square-root measurement yields the minimax strategy.\nLet us consider the minimax discrimination problem of the following four pure states ˆρ i = |H i H i |, under the assumption that B ji = 1 − δ ji .\n|H 1 = \t 1 2(1 + κ 2 ) |α |−α + |−α |α , |H 2 = \t 1 2(1 − κ 2 ) |α |−α − |−α |α , |H 3 = \t 1 2(1 + κ 2 ) |α |α + |−α |−α , |H 4 = \t 1 2(1 − κ 2 ) |α |α − |−α |−α ,\nwhere κ = α|−α and |α stands for the coherent state of light having amplitude α. These states are called the quasi-Bell states [24]. Since |H i are linearly independent, {|Φ i = ˆ G −1/2 |H i : 1 ≤ i ≤ 4} is an orthonormal basis for H under consideration, where ˆ G = 4 i=1 |H i H i |. Using the vectors in this basis, the states are respectively rewritten into the following form.\n|H 1 = C|Φ 1 + S|Φ 3 , |H 2 = |Φ 2 ,\n|H 3 = S|Φ 1 + C|Φ 3 , |H 4 = |Φ 4 ,\nC = √ 1 + D + √ 1 − D /2, S = √ 1 + D − √ 1 − D /2,\nFor these states, the minimax strategy is given by the square- root measurement\nThe necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for the minimax strategy of a ﬁnite number of decisions in quantum signal detection were derived in the case that the average Bayes cost is used as a quality function. In this paper, the set of the necessary and sufﬁcient conditions is shown in Eqs.(24)- (27). The ﬁrst two conditions, (24) and (25), come from the Bayes optimality, so that one may replace them to an equivalent statement in order to simplify the set of necessary and sufﬁcient conditions. For instance, the condition (24) may be removed [6] (See also [25]). To illustrate the utility of the necessary and sufﬁcient conditions, two examples were considered. For the binary pure-state case, explicit expressions of the minimax strategy, minimax distribution, and minimax value were respectively given. For the quasi-Bell states, it was shown that the square-root measurement yields the minimax strategy in terms of the average probability of decision error."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"O.
