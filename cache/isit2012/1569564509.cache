The states are know non-causally to the encoder. Two independent messages are sent: a common message and a private message transmitted by the informed encoder. We Ô¨Ånd precise characterizations of the capacity region. Our framework takes account of previously evaluated settings regarding point-to-point channels with actions and multiple-access channels with common messages. We obtain the capacity of the Gaussian action-dependent point-to-point"},"body":{"text":"\u2014Actions, Non-causal side information, Channel capacity, Channel coding, Binning, Gel\u2019fand-Pinsker Channel, Dirty paper coding."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"C.
