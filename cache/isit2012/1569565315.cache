Thanks to the bridge between the graphical model describing the iterative interference cance- lation process of CSA over the random access frame and the erasure recovery process of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes over the binary erasure channel (BEC), we propose an access protocol which is inspired by the convolutional LDPC code construction. The proposed protocol exploits the terminations of its graphical model to achieve the spatial coupling effect, attaining performance close to the theoretical limits of CSA.

Among them, some feedback-free RA protocols originally proposed in [2], [3] re-gained attention in the recent past [4], [5]. In [2], the capacity of the so-called collision channel without feedback (CCw/oFB) was analyzed, assuming slot-aligned but completely asynchronous users\u2019 transmissions. Moreover, a simple approach to achieve error-free transmission (in noise- free setting) over the CCw/oFB was proposed. In the context of the CCw/oFB, the capacity is deﬁned as maximum packet transmission rate per slot, which allows the receiver to recover the packets with an arbitrarily-small error probability (in noise- free conditions).\nThe approach of [2] consists of assigning different peri- odic protocol (access) sequences to the users. Each sequence deﬁnes in which slots each user is allowed to access the shared channel. Furthermore, the users encode their packets by means of erasure correcting codes. The user\u2019s packet can be recovered whenever a sufﬁcient number of codeword segments are received collision free. Hence, by selecting proper protocol sequences, it is possible to ensure that a sufﬁcient number of segments per user are recovered, even if the beginning of the different protocol sequences is unsynchronized. In this way, a\nsymmetric capacity 1 equal to 1/e [packets/slot] is achieved as N → ∞, where N is the number of users accessing the RA channel. The same capacity is achieved also in the unslotted case. Although simple, the approach of [2] poses some challenges, especially if a large (and varying) number of users has to be served [3], [4].\nRecently, RA schemes proﬁting from successive interfer- ence cancelation (SIC) have been introduced and analyzed [6]\u2013[9]. These schemes share the feature of canceling the interference caused by collided packets on the slots where they have been transmitted whenever a clean (uncollided) copy of them is detected. In [8], [9] it was shown that the SIC process can be well modeled by means of a bipartite graph. The anal- ysis proposed in [8], [9] resembles density evolution analysis of low-density parity-check (LDPC) and doubly-generalized LDPC (D-GLDPC) codes over erasure channels [10]\u2013[12]. By exploiting design techniques from the LDPC context, a remarkably-high capacity (e.g. up to 0.8 [packets/slot]) can be achieved in practical implementations. The schemes considered in [6]\u2013[8] assume a feedback from the receiver to achieve a zero packet loss rate.\nA scheme based on the coded slotted ALOHA (CSA) of [9] has been analyzed in the context of the CCw/oFB in [13]. An upper bound on the maximum load G sustainable at a scheme rate R, has been derived as the unique positive solution to\nin [0, 1). Still in [13] it was shown how this bound can be tightly approached by a careful selection of the distribution of the codes to be used at users for encoding their packets.\nIn this paper, we propose another means for approaching the bound deﬁned by (1), which is based on spatial coupling. Spatial coupling effects were initially devised in the context of density evolution analysis of convolutional LDPC codes over the binary erasure channel (BEC) [14]\u2013[17] and the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel [18]. Subsequently, its application to other settings relying on sparse graph represen- tations has been investigated (see e.g. [19]\u2013[21]). By imposing some constraints on the CSA access scheme, we show how the threshold under the iterative (IT) SIC process saturates towards a suitably-deﬁned equivalent of the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) decoding threshold of LDPC ensembles.\nWe recall next the basic model adopted for the description of CSA. We consider a slotted RA scheme where slots are grouped in medium access control (MAC) frames, all with\nthe same length (in slots). Each user is frame- and slot- synchronous, and attempts at most one burst (i.e., packet) transmission per MAC frame. Each burst has a time duration T slot , whereas the MAC frame is of time duration T frame . Neglecting guard times, the MAC frame is composed of M = T frame /T slot slots. We consider a population of N users, with N ≫ M . Users are characterized by a sporadic activity, i.e., at the beginning of a MAC frame each user generates a burst to be transmitted within the MAC frame with probability ǫ ≪ 1, where ǫ is called activation probability. Users attempting the transmission within a MAC frame are referred to as active users. On the contrary, users that are idle during a MAC frame are referred to as inactive users. We denote the population size normalized to the frame size by α = N/M . The number of active users is modeled by the random variable N a , which is binomially-distributed with mean value E[N a ] = N ǫ. We say that the average offered channel trafﬁc (representing the average number of bursts transmissions per slot) is\nWe consider a CSA scheme based on (d, 1) repetition codes, which is equivalent to a d-regular contention resolution diver- sity slotted Aloha (CRDSA) scheme [6]. More speciﬁcally, at the beginning of a MAC frame, each user selects d slots with a uniform probability out of the M frame slots. If the user is active, it transmits d copies of its burst in the d selected slots. We deﬁne R = 1/d as the rate of the scheme. In each burst replica, a pointer to the position of the other copies is included,\ne.g., in a dedicated header ﬁeld. Whenever a clean burst (i.e., a burst which did not collide) is successfully decoded, the pointer is used to determine the slots where its copies have been transmitted. Supposing that a another replica of this burst has collided, it is possible to subtract, from the signal received in the corresponding slot, the interference contribution of the twin burst. This may allow the decoding of another burst transmitted in the same slot. The SIC proceeds iteratively, i.e., cleaned bursts may allow solving other collisions. An example of a MAC frame with M = 4 slots and N a = 3 active users is depicted in Fig. 1, where the repetition rate is d = 2.\nConsidering a MAC frame composed of M slots and a population of N = αM users, the frame status can be described by a bipartite graph, G = (B, S, E), consisting of a set B of N burst nodes (one for each user), a set S of M sum nodes (one for each slot in the frame), and a set E of edges. An edge connects a burst node (BN) b i ∈ B to a sum node (SN) s j ∈ S if and only if the j-th slot has been selected by the i-th user at the beginning of the MAC frame. The graph obtained by expurgating from G the BNs associated with inactive users and their adjacent edges is called the residual graph and is denoted by G a = (B a , S, E a ). Here, B a ⊆ B is the subset of BNs associated with the active users, and E a ⊆ E is the subset of the edges associated with the transmitted burst copies. An example of the residual graph representing the MAC frame of Fig. 1 is given in Fig. 2.\nThe SIC process can be represented through a message- passing along the edges of the graph. As in [6], [8], we make use of two assumptions which allows simplifying the SIC process analysis in the graphical model. First, we assume that perfect SIC is performed. Second, we claim that, whenever a clean (collision-free) burst is present in a slot, decoding suc- ceeds with a probability that is essentially 1. It has been shown in [6], [8] that these assumptions are accurate enough to model the SIC process down to low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) with moderate-complexity signal processing algorithms.\nThanks to this simpliﬁcation, the SIC procedure is equiva- lent to iterative decoding of an LDPC code with N variable nodes and M check nodes over a BEC with erasure probability ǫ (coinciding with the activation probability). All variable nodes have degree d, while the check node degrees follow a Poisson distribution [8] with average degree dN/M = dα. The nominal code rate is thus R 0 = 1 − M/N = 1 − 1/α.\nFor large frames ( M → ∞) and for a given normalized population size α, CSA shows a threshold behavior. For an activation probability ǫ lower than a threshold value ǫ IT block 2 , vanishing burst error probability can be achieved by iterating SIC. The threshold ǫ IT block can be analyzed via density evolution over the residual graph G a according to the recursions\nwhere ˜ ρ h is the fraction of edges in G a connected to SNs with degree h in the residual code graph, and ˜ ρ(x) = h ˜ ρ h x h−1 . In (2) and (3), q ℓ and p ℓ denote the probabilities that an edge in the residual graph carries an erasure outgoing from a BN and from a SN, respectively, at the ℓ-th iteration. Since the number of collisions in a slot follows a Poisson distribution,\nThus, the threshold ǫ IT block is given by the supremum of the set of ǫ > 0 such that\nThe threshold can be expressed equivalently in terms of offered trafﬁc. By recalling that G = ǫα, the threshold G IT block is given by the supremum of the set of G > 0 such that\nIn this section, we modify the access rules of CSA to implement a convolutional-oriented structure that enables the exploitation of the spatial coupling effect.\nThe modiﬁed access rules are summarized next (see also Fig. 3). A super-frame is divided into M f = l+d−1 frames of M slots each. The slots belonging to the same frame constitute a slot type set. A user becoming active at the beginning of a frame (with probability ǫ) transmits a burst in a slot picked uniformly at random within that frame. Furthermore, a copy of the burst is sent in each of the following d − 1 frames in a slot picked with uniform probability in each frame. The set of users becoming active at the beginning of the i-th frame is referred to as the type- i user set. Similarly, the slots belonging to the j-th frame are referred to as type-j slots. The expected size of a user set is E[N u ] = ǫN . Thus, as before we can deﬁne the offered trafﬁc G as G = E[N u ]/M = ǫN/M .\nAfter transmission of the l-th frame, transmissions from new users are forbidden, and the following d − 1 frames are ﬁlled just with the copies of the bursts whose transmissions have been initiated during the past d − 1 frames. Once all the burst copies have been transmitted, a new transmission cycle begins, i.e., a new super-frame is initialized.\nA (residual) bipartite graph description of the recovery process is obtained as follows. We associate a BN to each user. Similarly, we associate a SN to each slot. The BNs corresponding to users of type i are clustered in type-i BN groups, whereas the SNs related to slots of type i are clustered in type- i SN groups. The number of BN types connected to a SN type- j group is denoted by δ j (degree of the type- j SN group). Note that δ j ∈ {1, . . . , d}. The type-i BN group is said to be neighbor of a type- j SN group (and viceversa) when the nodes belonging to the type- i BN group are connected to some nodes in the type- j SN group. The indexes of the\ngroups that are neighbors of the type- j SN group form the set N s j , while the indexes of the groups that are neighbors of the type- i BN group form the set N b i . Note that the period in which new user transmissions are blocked is equivalent to the termination in the context of convolutional LDPC codes. 3 An example of a super-frame structure is displayed in Fig. 3. The bursts transmitted into termination frames experience a lower collision probability than the other bursts, thus boot-strapping the iterative decoding process through the coupled structure.\nLet p j be the probability that an edge incident on the type- j SN group carries an erasure message towards the BNs, after SN processing at the generic SIC iteration. Analogously, let q j be the probability that an edge incident on the type- j SN group carries an erasure message towards the type- j SNs, after BN processing at the generic SIC iteration. Moreover, let q i→j be the probability that an edge emanating from the type- i BN group carries an erasure message towards the type- j SN group (with j ∈ N b i ), after BN processing at the generic SIC iteration. The physical load (i.e., the load including burst copies) for the i-th sub-frame is given by G (i) = G · δ i .\nNext, we deﬁne SN degree distributions from an edge perspective as\nwhere ρ (j) t is the fraction of the edges emanating from type- j SNs and incident on type-j SNs with degree t. Density evolution equations can be now derived as follows, where ℓ is the iteration index. For the type- j SN group we have\np j,ℓ = 1 − ρ (j) (1 − q j,ℓ ) where\nThe SIC IT thresholds for both block-based CSA and its convolutional counterpart are plotted in Fig. 4 versus the bound (1), as functions of the rate R = 1/d. The thresholds for the spatially coupled access scheme are denoted by G IT conv , to emphasize the analogy with convolutional LDPC ensembles. The large SIC IT thresholds attained by the convolutional CSA scheme allow to tightly approach, already for d = 3, the limit imposed by (1). For d ≥ 4, an impressive offered trafﬁc, very close to 1 [packet/slot], can be handled by the convolutional CSA scheme with vanishing packet (i.e., burst) loss probability (in the asymptotic setting). The bound for higher rates R could be tightly approached by spatially-coupled CSA based on non- trivial (d, k) constituent codes with rate k/d > 1/2 [9].\nWe now introduce an enhanced decoding algorithm for the conventional (block) CSA case of Section II, which serves to derive an upper bound on the achievable threshold for CSA schemes, and to investigate threshold saturation effects for the convolutional scheme. This algorithm mimics the MAP decoder of an LDPC code over the BEC, and we refer to it as genie-aided maximum-a-posteriori (GA-MAP) decoder.\nFrom an analysis viewpoint, the relation between the trans- mitted bursts and the slot observations can be simpliﬁed by to a matrix representation of the graph via an M × N a binary matrix Q, where q i,j = 1 iff BN b j is connected to SN s i in G a , and q i,j = 0 otherwise. We denote by u the length-N a\nbinary vector whose j-th element u j is associated with the modulated burst of user j. We also denote by y the length-M binary vector whose i-th element is associated with the i-th slot. An equation system relating u and y is thus\nIn this simpliﬁed setting, the elements of u and y are binary digits which provide abstraction of the actual bursts transmitted by the users and the signals received in the slots, respectively. Upon receiving y and assuming that Q is revealed by a genie, the GA-MAP decoder solves (7) for u via Gauss- Jordan elimination (GJE). Note that the iterative decoding process described in Section II succeeds only if the matrix Q can be posed in triangular form by row/column permutations, i.e., only if the equation system (7) can be solved iteratively. Thus, the GA-MAP decoder performance (which is optimum with respect to (7)) provides a lower bound on the decoding error probability of the iterative SIC process.\nWe establish next a bridge towards the MAP decoding threshold of LDPC codes under MAP decoding in order to derive the threshold of a d-regular CSA scheme under GA-MAP decoding, G MAP block . We deﬁne C d,M,N to be the ensemble of all length- N codes given by the null space of an M ×N binary parity-check matrix H, having constant column weight d and where the d 1s in each column are placed in random positions, according to a uniform distribution. Recall that, for the codes in this ensemble, the nominal rate is given by R 0 = 1 − M/N . From a bipartite graph perspective, the graph of a code in C d,M,N possesses a constant variable node degree, d v = d whereas, as N and M = (1 − R 0 )N tend to inﬁnity, the check node degree distribution follows a Poisson distribution with mean value d c = dN/M . The edge-oriented check node degree distribution is thus given by ρ(x) = exp(−d c (1 − x)) [8].\nRecall that the ensemble under consideration can be placed in analogy to the scheme introduced in Section II where N is the user population size, M is the number of slots per frame and d is the repetition rate for the bursts. The IT decoding threshold ǫ IT block over the BEC for the ensemble C d,M,N , N → ∞, is calculated as the maximum value of the channel erasure probability ǫ (the analogous of the activation probability, in the CSA context) for which the erasure probabilities q i , p i (where i is the iteration index) converge to an arbitrarily-low positive value, for i → ∞, according to\np i = ǫq d−1 i−1 , \t (8) q i = 1 − ρ(1 − p i ) = 1 − exp(−d c p i ). \t (9)\nThe average extrinsic erasure probability p e (ǫ) under IT de- coding is obtained ﬁnally as\nDeﬁning an average extrinsic erasure probability function p MAP e (ǫ) also for the MAP decoder, from the area theorem of [22] the area below p MAP e (ǫ) equals the ensemble rate. By\nnoting that for any ǫ, p MAP e (ǫ) ≤ p IT e (ǫ), an upper bound [23] on ǫ MAP block is given by the value ¯ ǫ MAP block such that\nThis allows us also to get an upper bound on the decoding threshold for a d-regular block CSA scheme, under GA-MAP decoding. Letting α = N/M = 1/(1 − R 0 ), the GA-MAP threshold of CSA can be upper bounded as\nTable I illustrates the threshold achievable by conventional CSA schemes employing a regular distribution at the BNs based on (d, 1) repetition codes. For the spatially-coupled scheme, a super-frame composed by M f = l + d − 1 frames has been considered, with l = 200. Moreover, the normalized user population size is α = 100, i.e. the number of users is 100 times larger than the number of slots per frame. We additionally provide the upper bounds on the threshold achievable by the conventional CSA scheme under the GA-MAP recovery process. The derivation of the MAP thresholds serves to illustrate how, also in this context, the imposition of a convolutional-like structure to the access scheme allows achieving the threshold saturation effect as numerically shown in Table I. The upper bound on the achievable threshold G ∗ according to (1), given by the solution of G = 1 − exp(−G/R), is provided too. Accordingly, we evaluated the normalized efﬁciency of the proposed scheme as\nAs already observed in the LDPC context, larger degrees allow to approach the bound more tightly.\nIn this paper we introduced a spatially-coupled RA scheme for the CCw/oFB which attains capacities close to 1 [packet/slot] in the asymptotic (i.e., for large frames) set- ting. A bridge between the graphical model describing the iterative interference cancelation process of the proposed RA over the random access frame and the erasure recovery process of low-density parity-check codes over the binary erasure channel has been set, which allows computing an upper bound on the capacity achievable by an enhanced (genie-aided) decoder. The saturation of the SIC IT capacity of the proposed\nscheme towards the threshold under genie-aided decoding has been numerically demonstrated."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"N.
