These results have provided fundamental insights for modern communication system design. Most Shan- non capacity results (e.g. [1], [2]) focus on the analog ca- pacity commensurate with sampling at or above twice the channel bandwidth, which does not explicitly account for the effects upon capacity of sub-Nyquist rate sampling. In practice, however, hardware and power limitations may preclude sampling at the Nyquist rate associated with the channel bandwidth. On the other hand, although the Nyquist sampling rate is necessary for perfect recov- ery of bandlimited functions, this rate can be excessive when certain signal structures are properly exploited. Inspired by recent \u201ccompressive sensing\u201d ideas, sub- Nyquist sampling approaches have been developed to exploit the structure of various classes of input signals with different structures (e.g. [3], [4]).\nAlthough optimal sampling methods have been ex- tensively explored in the sampling literature, they are\ntypically investigated either under a noiseless setting, or based on statistical reconstruction measures (e.g. mean squared error (MSE)). Berger et. al. [5] related MSE- based optimal sampling with capacity for several special channels but did not derive the sampled capacity for more general channels. Our recent work [6] established a new framework that characterized sub-Nyquist sampled channel capacity for a broad class of sampling methods, including ﬁlter-bank and modulation-bank sampling [3], [7]. For these sampling methods, we determined optimal sampling structures based on capacity as a metric, illu- minated intriguing connections between MIMO channel capacity and capacity of undersampled channels, as well as a new connection between capacity and MSE.\nOne interesting fact we discovered in this previous work is the non-monotonicity of capacity with sam- pling rate under ﬁlter- and modulation-bank sampling, assuming an equal sampling rate per branch for a given number of branches. This indicates that more sophisti- cated sampling schemes, adaptive to the sampling rate, are needed to maximize capacity under sub-Nyquist rate constraints, including both uniform and nonuniform sampling. Beurling pioneered the investigation of general nonuniform sampling for bandlimited functions. How- ever, it is unclear which sampling method can best ex- ploit the channel structure, thereby maximizing sampled capacity under a sub-Nyquist sampling rate constraint. Although several classes of sampling methods were shown in [6] to have a closed-form capacity solution, the capacity limit might not exist for general sampling. It remains unknown whether there exists a capacity upper bound over a general class of sub-Nyquist sampling systems and, if so, when the bound is achievable.\nIn this paper, we derive the sub-Nyquist sampled channel capacity for a general class of time-preserving nonuniform sampling methods. We demonstrate that the fundamental limit can be achieved through ﬁlter-bank sampling with varied sampling rate at different branches, or a single branch of modulation and ﬁltering followed by uniform sampling. Our results indicate that irregular\nsampling sets, which are more complicated to realize in hardware, do not provide capacity increase compared with regular uniform sampling sets for a broad class of channels. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the optimal sampling schemes suppress aliasing through ﬁlter bank, modulation, or input optimization.\nWe consider a waveform channel, which is mod- eled as a linear time-invariant (LTI) ﬁlter with im- pulse response h(t) and frequency response H(f) =\nr(t) = h(t) ∗ x(t) + η(t), \t (1) where x(t) is the transmitted signal, and η(t) is station- ary Gaussian noise with power spectral density S η (f ) . We assume throughout that perfect channel state infor- mation is known at both the transmitter and receiver.\nThe analog channel output is passed through M (1 ≤ M ≤ ∞) linear preprocessing systems each followed by a pointwise sampler, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The preprocessed output y k (t) at the kth branch is obtained by applying a linear operator T k to r(t), i.e. y k (t) = T k (r(t)) . The linear operators can be time-varying, and include ﬁltering and modulation as special cases. We deﬁne the impulse response q(t, τ) of a time-varying system as the output seen at time t due to an impulse in the input at time τ. The pointwise sampler following the preprocessor can be nonuniform. The preprocessed output y k (t) is sampled at times t k,n (n ∈ Z), yielding a sequence y k [n] = y k (t k,n ) . At the kth branch, the sampling set is deﬁned by Λ k := {t k,n | n ∈ Z} . When t k,n = nT s , Λ k is said to be uniform with period T s .\nIn general, the sampling set Λ may be irregular. This calls for a generalized deﬁnition of the sampling rate. One notion commonly used in sampling theory is the Beurling density [8] as deﬁned below.\nDeﬁnition 1 (Beurling Density). For a sampling set Λ, the upper and lower Beurling density are deﬁned as \nWhen D + (Λ) = D − (Λ) , the sampling set Λ is said to be of uniform Beurling density D (Λ) := D − (Λ) .\nWhen the sampling set is uniform with period T s , the Beurling density is D(Λ) = 1/T s , which coincides with our conventional deﬁnition of the sampling rate.\nGiven a preprocessed output y k (t) , we can use Beurl- ing density to characterize the sampling rate on y k (t) . However, since the preprocessor might distort the time scale of the input, the resulting \u201csampling rate\u201d might not make physical sense, as illustrated below.\nExample 1 (Compressor). Consider a preprocessor de- ﬁned by the relation y(t) = T (r(t)) = r (Lt) with L ≥ 2 being a positive integer. If we apply a uniform sampling set Λ = {t n : t n = n/f s } on y(t), then the sampled sequence at a \u201csampling rate\u201d f s is given by y[n] = y (n/f s ) = r (nL/f s ) , which corresponds to sampling r(t) at rate f s /L . The compressor effectively time-warps the signal, thus resulting in a mismatch of the time scales between the input and output.\nThe example of the compressor illustrates that the notion of a given sampling rate may be misleading for systems that exhibit time warping. Hence, our results will focus on sampling that preserves time scales. A class of linear systems that preserves time scales are modulation operators (y(t) = p(t)x(t), ∀t), which perform pointwise scaling of the input, and hence do not change the time scale. Another class are periodic systems which includes LTI ﬁltering, and are deﬁned as follows.\nDeﬁnition 2 (Periodic System). A linear preprocessing system is said to be periodic with period T q if its impulse response q(t, τ) satisﬁes\nq(t, τ ) = q(t + T q , τ + T q ), ∀t, τ ∈ R. \t (2) A more general class of systems that preserve the time\nscale can be generated through modulation and periodic subsystems. Speciﬁcally, we can deﬁne a general time- preserving system by connecting a set of modulation or periodic operators in parallel or in serial. This leads to the following deﬁnition.\nDeﬁnition 3 (Time-preserving System). Given an index set I, a preprocessing system T : x(t) → {y k (t), k ∈ I} is said to be time-preserving if\n(1) The system input is passed through |I| (possibly countably many) branches of linear preprocessors, yield- ing a set of analog outputs {y k (t) | k ∈ I}.\n(2) In each branch, the preprocessor comprises a set of periodic or modulation operators connected in serial.\nWith a preprocessing system that preserves the time scale, we can now deﬁne the aggregate sampling rate through Beurling density.\nDeﬁnition 4. A sampling system is said to be time- preserving with sampling rate f s if\n(2) The preprocessed output y k (t) is sampled by a sampling set Λ k = {t l,k | l ∈ Z} with a uniform Beurling density f k, s , which satisﬁes  k ∈I f k, s = f s .\nSuppose that the transmit signal x(t) is constrained to the time interval [−T, T ], and the received signal y(t) is sampled and observed over [−T, T ]. For a given sampling system P that consists of a preprocessor T and a sampling set Λ, and a given time duration T , the capacity C P T (f s , P ) is deﬁned as\nsubject to a power constraint E( 1 2T ´ T −T |x(t)| 2 dt) ≤ P . Here, {y[t n ] } [ −T,T ] denotes the set of samples obtained within time [−T, T ]. The sub-Nyquist sampled channel capacity for the given system can be studied by tak- ing the limit as T → ∞. It was shown in [6] that lim T →∞ C P T (f s , P ) exists for a broad class of sampling methods. We caution, however, that the existence of the limit is not guaranteed for all sampling methods, e.g. the limit might not exist for an irregular sampling set. The capacity and an upper bound under general nonuniform sampling is deﬁned as follows.\nDeﬁnition 5. (1) C P (P ) is said to be the capacity of a given sampled analog channel if lim T →∞ C P T (f s , P ) exists and C P (f s , P ) = lim T →∞ C P T (f s , P ) ;\n(2) C P u (P ) is said to be a capacity upper bound of the sampled channel if C P u (f s , P ) ≥ lim sup T →∞ C P T (f s , P ) .\nThe above capacity is deﬁned for a speciﬁc sampling system. Another metric of interest is the maximum date rate for all sampling schemes within a general class of nonuniform sampling systems. This motivates us to\ndeﬁne the sub-Nyquist sampled channel capacity for the class of linear time-preserving systems as follows.\nDeﬁnition 6 (Sampled Capacity under Time-preserv- ing Linear Sampling). (1) C(f s , P ) is said to be the sampled capacity of an analog channel under time- preserving linear sampling for a given sampling rate f s if C(f s , P ) = sup P C P (f s , P ) ;\n(2) C u (P ) is said to be a capacity upper bound of the sampled channel under this sampling if C u (f s , P ) ≥ sup P lim sup T →∞ C P T (f s , P ) .\nHere, the supremum on P is over all time-preserving linear sampling systems.\nA time-preserving sampling system preserves the time scale of the signal, and hence does not compress or expand the frequency response. We now determine an upper limit on the sampled channel capacity for this class of general nonuniform sampling systems.\nTheorem 1 (Converse). Consider a time-preserving sampling system with sampling rate f s . Suppose that the output impulse response of the sampled channel is of ﬁnite duration, and that there exists a frequency set B m that satisﬁes µ (B m ) = f s and\nwhere µ (·) denotes the Lebesgue measure. Then the sampled channel capacity is upper bounded by\n1 2\nIn other words, the upper limit is equivalent to the maximum capacity of a channel whose spectral occu- pancy is no larger than f s . The above result basically implies that even if we allow for more complex irregular sampling sets, the sampled capacity cannot exceed the one commensurate with the analog capacity when con- straining all transmit signals to the interval of bandwidth f s that experience the highest SNR. Accordingly, the optimal input distribution will lie in this frequency set. This theorem also indicates that the capacity is attained when aliasing is suppressed by the sampling structure,\nas will be seen later in our capacity-achieving scheme. When the optimal frequency interval B m is selected, a water ﬁlling power allocation strategy is performed over the spectral domain with water level ν.\nThis theorem can be approximately interpreted based on a Fourier domain analysis. The Fourier transform of the analog channel output is given by H(f)X(f)+N(f), where X(f) and N(f) denote, respectively, the Fourier response of x(t) and η(t). This output is passed through the sampling system to yield a sequence at a rate f s , which can be further mapped to the space of bandlim- ited functions L 2 ( −f s /2, f s /2) through linear mapping without frequency warping. The whitening operation for the noise component, combined with the sampling system operator, forms an orthonormal mapping from L 2 ( −∞, ∞) to L 2 ( −f s /2, f s /2) . The optimal orthonor- mal mapping that maximizes SNR is to extract out a frequency set B m of size f s that contains the frequency components with the highest SNR, which leads to the capacity upper bound (3).\nThe outline of the proof of Theorem 1 is sketched below. We start from the capacity of periodic sampling whose sampled channel capacity exists, and then derive the upper bound through ﬁnite-duration approximation of the true channels. Details can be found in [9].\nSuppose ﬁrst that the whole sampling system is pe- riodic, where the impulse response q(t, τ) is periodic with period T q (f s T q ∈ Z) and the sampling set obeys t k+f s T q = t k + T q , ∀k ∈ Z. The periodicity of the system guarantees the existence of lim T →∞ C P T . Speciﬁcally, denote by Q k (f ) the Fourier transform\nQ k (f ) := ´ ∞ −∞ q(t k , t k − t) exp(−j2πft)dt, and intro- duce an f q T s × ∞ dimensional matrix F q (f ) and an inﬁnite diagonal square matrix F h (f ) such that for all m, l ∈ Z and 1 ≤ k ≤ f q T s ,\n(F q ) k,l (f ) := Q k (f + lf q ) , (F h ) l,l (f ) = H (f + lf q ) . We can then express in closed form the sampled analog capacity as given in the following theorem.\nTheorem 2 (Capacity for Periodic Sampling). Suppose the sampling system P is periodic with period T q = 1/f q and sampling rate f s . Assume that |H(f)Q k (f ) | 2 / S η (f ) is bounded and satisﬁes ´ ∞ −∞ |H(f)Q k (f ) | 2 / S η (f ) < ∞ for all 1 ≤ k ≤ f q T s , and deﬁne F w = \nwhere ν is chosen according to the water-ﬁlling strategy. We observe that the capacity of any periodic sampling\nNow we consider the more general sampling system that might not be periodic. For a given input and output duration [−T, T ], the impulse response h(t, τ) ( |t|, |τ| ≤ T ) can be extended periodically to generate an impulse response of a periodic system. Suppose ﬁrst that the impulse response is of ﬁnite duration, then for sufﬁciently large T , the sampled capacity C T can be upper bounded arbitrarily closely by the capacity of the generated periodic system, which are further bounded by the upper limit (3). Since the impulse response is constrained in L 2 space, the leakage signal between different blocks can be made arbitrarily weak by intro- ducing a guard zone with length T 1 − . This shows the full generality of our upper bound.\nFor most scenarios of physical interest, the capacity upper bound given in Theorem 1 can be achieved through ﬁlter-bank sampling.\nTheorem 3 (Achievability). Suppose that the SNR |H(f)| 2 / S η (f ) of the analog channel is continuous and Riemann integrable. Then the maximizing frequency set B m deﬁned in Theorem 1 can be divided into B m = ∪ i B i ∪ D, where D contains a set of singular points, B i is a continuous interval, and D and B i (i ∈ N) are non-overlapping sets. The upper bound in (3) can be achieved by ﬁlter-bank sampling. Speciﬁcally, in the k th\nand the ﬁlter is followed by a uniform sampler with sampling rate µ (B k ) .\nSince the bandwidth of B i may be irrational and the system may require an inﬁnite number of ﬁlters, the sampling system is in general aperiodic. However, ﬁlter- bank sampling with varied sampling rates in different branches outperforms all other sampling mechanisms in maximizing capacity.\nThe optimality of ﬁlter-bank sampling immediately leads to another optimal sampling structure. As we have shown in [6], ﬁlter-bank sampling can be replaced by a single branch of modulation and ﬁltering as illustrated in Fig. 2, which can approach the capacity arbitrar- ily closely if the spectral support can be divided into subbands with constant SNR. A channel of physical interest can often be approximated as piecewise constant in this way. Given the maximizing frequency set B m , we ﬁrst suppress the frequency components outside B m using an LTI preﬁlter. A modulation module is then applied to move all frequency components within B m to the baseband [−f s /2, f s /2] . The aliasing effect can be signiﬁcantly mitigated by appropriate choices of modulation weights for different spectral subbands. We then employ another low-pass ﬁlter to suppress out-of- band signals, and sample the output using a pointwise uniform sampler. The optimizing modulation sequence can be found in [6], [9]. Compared with ﬁlter-bank sampling, a single branch of modulation and ﬁltering only requires the design of a low-pass ﬁlter, a band-pass ﬁlter and a multiplication module, which are typically lower complexity to implement than a ﬁlter bank.\nThe above analytical results characterize the sampled capacity for a general class of sampling methods. Some properties of the capacity results are as follows.\nMonotonicity. It can be seen from (3) that increasing the sampling rate from f s to ˜ f s requires us to crop out another frequency set ˜ B m of size ˜ f s that has the highest SNRs. The original frequency set B m we choose must be a subset of ˜ B m , and hence the sampled capacity with rate ˜ f s is no lower than that with rate f s .\nIrregular sampling set. Sampling with irregular sampling sets, while requiring complicated reconstruc- tion techniques [8], does not outperform ﬁlter-bank or modulation-bank sampling with regular uniform sam- pling sets in maximizing achievable data rate.\nAlias suppression. Aliasing does not allow a higher capacity to be achieved. The optimal sampling method corresponds to the optimal alias-suppression strategy. This is in contrast to the beneﬁts obtained through scrambling of spectral contents in many sub-Nyquist sampling schemes with unknown signal supports.\nPerturbation of sampling set. If the optimal ﬁlter- bank or modulation sampling is employed, mild per- turbation of post-ﬁltering uniform sampling sets does not degrade the sampled capacity. For example, suppose that a sampling rate ˆ f s is used in any branch and the sampling set satisﬁes   ˆt n − n/ ˆ f s    ≤ ˆ f s /4 . Kadec has shown that  exp  j2πˆ t n f  | n ∈ Z  also forms a Riesz basis of L 2 ( − ˆ f s /2, ˆ f s /2) , thereby preserving informa- tion integrity. The sampled capacity is invariant under mild perturbation of the sampling sets.\nHardware implementation. When the sampling rate is increased from f s1 to f s2 , we need only to insert an additional ﬁlter bank of overall sampling rate f s2 −f s1 to select another set of spectral components with bandwidth f s2 − f s1 . The adjustment of the hardware system for ﬁlter-bank sampling is incremental with no need to rebuild the whole system from scratch.\nThis work was supported by the NSF Center for Science of Information, the Interconnect Focus Center of the Semiconductor Research Corporation, and BSF Transformative Science Grant 2010505."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"R.
