Since signal and interference strengths are inﬂuenced by relative node positions, the spatial distribution of nodes strongly inﬂuences the performance of these networks. Most works on wireless networks with spatially-distributed nodes assume that the locations of active nodes are independent, a good model for networks with uniformly-random spatial node distributions and uncoordinated transmissions. In many situations however, active nodes may be spatially correlated, e.g. in networks with coordinated transmissions such as networks with Medium- Access-Control (MAC), and systems with signiﬁcant physical constraints on how close nodes may get to each other such as vehicular networks.\nThe analysis of wireless networks with spatially correlated transmitters is well known to be difﬁcult. Most related results in the literature deal with interference modeling for systems with no diversity, and utilize bounds or asymptotic approaches to handle the complexity associated with correlated node positions. For instance [1] analyzes hard-core networks (where nodes are prohibited from transmitting in the vicinity of other nodes), by ﬁnding bounds on the mean interference in these networks. [2] analyzes clustered networks and [3] and [4] analyze networks with correlated node positions in the high\nSignal-to-Interference-Ratio and reliability regime, where the density of active nodes is small. For multi-antenna systems, [5] analyzes interference-alignment in such networks and [6] analyzes Carrier-Sense-Multiple-Access (CSMA) networks with multiple antennas using a Poisson approximation for node positions.\nIn this work, we consider interference-limited wireless networks with interferers distributed on a plane with receive diversity and linear Minimum-Mean-Square-Error (MMSE) receivers. This diversity could be from multiple antennas, multiple frequencies or other forms of diversity. We consider interference-limited networks in order to focus on networks with a high density of active nodes. The interferers that are actively transmitting in this work are spatially correlated. In particular, the active interferers in our model could come from a dependent thinning of an underlying process of independent node positions which we call the dependent thinning model. Note that our dependent thinning model can be used to analyze hard core models that are very similar to type I and type II Matern hard-core processes, which have been used to approximate CSMA networks (see e.g. [7], [3] and others). Hence our ﬁndings are useful to analyze the behavior of wire- less networks that have multi-antenna nodes with CSMA-like protocols, and networks with signiﬁcant physical limitations on minimum inter-node separation.\nWe use an asymptotic analysis to handle the complexity associated with correlated interferer positions, taking the num- ber of diversity branches N and interferers in the network to inﬁnity but keeping their ratio constant to derive simple approximations to appropriately normalized versions of the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise-Ratio (SINR) and achiev- able data rates (bits/symbol) when Gaussian transmissions are assumed, on a representative link. The asymptotic analysis indicates that as the diversity order at the receiver increases, the spatial dependence between active transmitters does not strongly inﬂuence the data rates in such networks which result in simple approximate expressions which we validate by Monte Carlo simulation.\nConsider a circular network of radius R centered at the origin, with a representative receiver at the origin. The repre- sentative receiver is in a link with a representative transmitter located at a ﬁxed point X T which is at distance r T from the origin. Note that these points are assumed to be deterministic in our model.\nThe representative receiver has N diversity branches (e.g. antennas or frequency diversity). In addition to the representa- tive transmitter, there are n other potential transmitters in the network which when active, are co-channel interferers to the representative link. Some of the potential transmitters will not be actively transmitting as described later in this section. Let the potential interferer locations be denoted X 1 , X 2 , · · · , X n with the distance of the i-th potential interferer from the origin denoted by r i = |X i |. The n potential interferers are i.i.d. with uniform probability in the circular network such that the area density of potential interferers ρ p satisﬁes\nThe average power (averaged over the fading realizations) received at each diversity branch of the representative receiver from an interferer at distance r i transmitting with power P i is p i = P i r −α i , with α > 2. The transmit powers of the potential interferers, P i either equal P t > 0, or zero, and the transmit power of the representative transmitter is ﬁxed at P t . There- fore, the vector of transmit powers P = (P 1 , P 2 , · · · , P n ) controls which of the potential interferers are active, and the representative transmitter is always active. We assume that the power used by the active transmitters P t = N α/2−1 P , with P a positive constant. We scale the transmit powers in this way to keep the system interference-limited (which is the focus of this work) as N increases. Without this assumption, as the diversity order of the system increases, the MMSE receiver will suppress interference to levels comparable to the noise resulting in a system that is no longer interference-limited. Scaling the transmit power with the diversity order in this manner ensures that the system remains interference-limited enabling a meaningful asymptotic analysis. Note that since the signal and interference powers are assumed to be equal in this work, their speciﬁc value does not inﬂuence the SINR when the noise power is negligible.\nThe vector y contains the sampled signals at the N diversity branches of the representative receiver and is given by\nwhere x i , is the transmitted symbol by node i, and g i is an N × 1 vector of i.i.d., zero-mean, unit variance random variables (not necessarily Gaussian). The N × 1 vector w represents independent zero-mean, circularly-symmetric Gaussian noise of variance σ 2 per complex dimension.\nThe asymptotic regime we shall consider is the limit as N , n and R → ∞, such that n/N = c > 0 and ρ p are constants, and\n(1) holds. All limiting results refer to this regime. The main results are given in terms of limiting values of a normalized version of the SINR, β N = N −α/2 r α T SINR, at the output of the MMSE receiver. This normalization is used because the (un-normalized) SINR grows with the number of diversity branches as N α/2 .\nThe active nodes in the network are assigned non- zero transmit powers by a function g(.) such that P = g (X 1 , · · · , X n ; X T ), where we emphasize that g(.) could de- pend on X T . g(.) controls which of the n potential interferers are transmitting, and since it is parameterized by X T , the transmit powers of the interferers are a function of the loca- tions of all potential transmitters (potential interferers and the target transmitter) in the network. We assume that g(.) results in a distribution of transmit powers that are stationary with respect to the indexing variable i, i.e. P 1 , P 2 , · · · , P i , · · · , P n are stationary with respect to i. Note that this is not the same as requiring spatial stationarity.\nThe correlation between the positions of the active nodes needs to satisfy a covariance constraint on the received powers from the potential interferers. Deﬁne a variable a i (x) which indicates if p i is less than or equal to x i.e.,\na i (x) = 1 {p i ≤x} , \t (3) where 1 {A} is the indicator function for the condition A. The correlation between active transmitters must be such that\n1 n\nfor all x > 0 . (4) amounts to requiring that the correlation between received powers at the origin due to the transmitters that are active decay at a certain rate as the number of potential interferers goes to inﬁnity. Finally, we require that for any i, as n, N, R → ∞,\n+ Pr(P i = 0). \t (5) This last requirement simply means that as the size of the network goes to inﬁnity, the probability of an interferer being active is independent of its distance from the origin.\nThe normalized SINR β N , converges with probability 1 to a deterministic limit as given in the theorem below.\nTheorem 1: In the limit as n, N → ∞ such that n/N = c > 0 and (1) hold, β N → β with probability 1 where β is the real, positive solution to the following equation.\n1 + τ β dτ + βσ 2 = 1 (6) where ρ = ρ p lim n→∞ Pr(P i > 0) and b = (πρ b N/n). Proof: Given in Appendix A.\nNote that ρ is the effective density of active transmissions in the limit. Additionally, note that when the N is large,\nthe SINR is not strongly inﬂuenced by the dependence of the transmit powers as β is only dependent on the marginal probability that a node is selected to transmit. This leads to simple approximations to the bits/symbol given later in this section as the complicated dependence between transmit powers becomes negligible with large N .\nAssuming that all nodes use Gaussian code books we estimate the bits/symbol using the Shannon formula, C N = log 2 (1 + SINR). By the continuity of the log function it can be shown that\nwith probability 1 as N → ∞ in the manner of Theorem 1. Furthermore, applying the bounded convergence theorem in the manner of [8], we can show that\nHence, log 2 1 + N α 2 β is a good approximation for the mean bits/symbol when the diversity order N is large.\nAdditionally, if the noise power is small and the diversity order of the system is much smaller than the number of potential interferers n, b is small, and the second two terms on the LHS of (6) are small. β N can then be approximated as\nwhich leads to the following approximation for the mean bits/symbol\nWe apply the above techniques to two hard-core models which we refer to as HC-I and HC-II, which are closely related to the Matern Type I and II models commonly used to model hard-core processes (e.g. see [9]). Hard-core models can serve as simple models for active nodes in systems with medium- access-control (MAC) protocols where nodes that are close to each other are not allowed to transmit simultaneously. For instance, the Matern Type II model has been suggested as a model for CSMA networks [10] in which nodes are not allowed to transmit if they detect an ongoing transmission in their vicinity.\nIn the HC-I model we assume that all n potential interferers in the radius R network are active unless they are within a distance h of any other interferer or the representative transmitter. In the HC-II model, each interferer is assigned an independent uniform (0, 1] random variable called a mark, where the mark assigned to the i-th interferer is M i . All potential interferers are active unless they are within a distance h of the representative transmitter, or if they are within a distance h of any interferer and have a higher mark than that interferer.\nIn comparison, the Matern type I and type II point processes are constructed from an underlying Poisson point process\nof intensity λ. For the Type I process, each point of the underlying Poisson process that is within a distance h from another point of the underlying process is removed. For the Type II process, a point of the underlying Poisson process is retained only if there is no other point of the Poisson process within a distance h of it which has a mark of lesser value. Thus, these processes are the result of dependent thinning of an underlying Poisson point process. To incorporate an active transmitter at a particular location, the Matern process has to be conditioned on having a node at that location which leads to added mathematical complexity as the probability of a node being at a particular point is zero. We sidestep this complexity for HC-I and HC-II by assuming that the representative transmitter is not part of the random process but is located at a deterministic point.\nRecall that (P 1 , P 2 , · · · , P n ) = g(X 1 , X 2 , · · · , X n ; X T ) assigns the transmit powers to the potential interferers and can be deﬁned as follows. For the HC-I model, g(.) assigns P i = 0 if either |X i −X T | < h or ∃j such that |X i −X j | < h. P i = P t otherwise. For the HC-II model, g(.) assigns P i = 0 if either |X i − X T | < h or ∃j such that |X i − X j | < h and M i > M j . P i = P t otherwise. These deﬁnitions of g(.) satisfy (4) as shown in Appendix B.\nFor the HC-I model, in the limit as R → ∞, Pr(P i > 0) = exp(−ρ p πh 2 ), which is the density of a Matern type I process. For the HC-II model in the limit as R → ∞, Pr(P i > 0) = 1 ρ p πh 2 (1 − exp(−ρ p πh 2 )), which is the density of a Matern type II process. Thus, the mean bits/symbol for these models are given by (8) with ρ = ρ p exp (−ρ p πh 2 ) or ρ =\nAssuming that the approximation in (8) holds, and making the simplifying assumption that each link in the network is of length r T , we can approximate the mean bits/symbol per unit area as\nMaximizing the RHS of (9) with respect to ρ by setting its derivative to zero yields,\n(10) where W 0 (z) is the principle branch of the Lambert-W func- tion. Substituting (10), we ﬁnd that at the optimal ρ the RHS of (9) is proportional to N r −2 T . Note that (10) can be used to ﬁnd the optimal exclusion radius h.\nWe conducted Monte Carlo simulations to validate the asymptotic results for the bits/symbol derived in the previous sections. We simulated both HC-I and HC-II networks with path-loss exponents of α = 4. The link-lengths r T for both sets of simulations were selected such that πρ p r 2 T = 1, i.e. on average 1 other potential interferer is closer to the\nrepresentative receiver than the representative transmitter. The radius of the guard zones h were varied as a function of r T and are given in the corresponding ﬁgures.\nFigure 1 illustrates the mean bits/symbol from simulations of the HC-I model with guard zones that are a multiple of the length of the representative link. Note from the ﬁgure that the asymptotic approximation is very close to the sim- ulated mean bits/symbol. For N ≥ 6 diversity branches, the simulated and asymptotic mean bits/symbol (from (8)) with ρ deﬁned appropriately) are virtually indistinguishable. Figure 2 illustrates the mean bits/symbol from simulations of the HC-II model with guard zones that are a multiple of the length of the representative link. Note from the ﬁgure that the asymptotic approximation is very close to the simulated mean bits/symbol, even when the number of diversity branches is small. Figure 3 shows the bits/symbol obtained from 100 simulations of the HC-II process for different receive diversity orders. The con- centration of points with increasing diversity order indicates that the bits/symbol concentrates on the asymptotic prediction which implies convergence in probability (although the theory predicts convergence with probability 1).\nAn asymptotic technique to compute the bits/symbol achiev- able in wireless networks where active potential interferers are\nspatially correlated and receivers have N diversity branches with linear MMSE processing. In particular, we consider networks which are the result of the dependent thinning of an underlying process of independent node positions. The thinning operation is such that the received powers of pairs of nodes satisfy a particular covariance criterion which are satisﬁed by the HC-I and HC-II models deﬁned in Section IV, which are analogous to Matern type I and II models which are popular hard-core models in stochastic geometry.\nFor systems satisfying our model, we ﬁnd that when the number of diversity branches N grows large, the dependence of the interferer locations on the bits/symbol of a representative link in the network plays a diminishing role. As a result, the mean spectral efﬁciency for large N can be accurately approx- imated using simple expressions. The asymptotic results are validated for ﬁnite-sized systems by Monte carlo simulations. These ﬁndings provide insight into wireless networks with correlated transmissions, for which only a limited number of results exist in the literature.\nWe thank the reviewers of this manuscript and its prior versions for constructive comments.\nThe main property we use to prove this theorem is the convergence of the empirical distribution function (e.d.f.) of the p i s which is the proportion of the p i s that are ≤ x. Note that the p i s are correlated random variables and the convergence of their e.d.f. is not as straightforward as it would be if they were uncorrelated. Note that the set of a i s for which P i > 0 forms an associated set, since any subset of independent random variables forms an associated set (see e.g. [11] Chapter 20). If the associated random variables satisfy the covariance requirement in (4), it is known that the a i s\nobey the strong law of large numbers [12]. From (3), the e.d.f. of received interference powers H n (x) = 1 n n i=1 a i , and as n, N, R → ∞ in the manner of Theorem 1,\nwith probability 1. Note that this holds even though P t grows with N as the difference between the terms diminishes exponentially [12].\nFrom [13], it is known that if the e.d.f. of the received interference powers ( H n (x) here) of a system with an MMSE receiver in the presence of interferers converges to a limit H(x), the limiting SINR converges with probability 1 to an asymptotic limit which is given by the positive, non-zero solution for β in the following equation:\n1 + xβ . \t (12) What remains now is to ﬁnd H(x) and evaluate (12). From [14], it is known that the CDF of N α/2 r −α i is\nwhere R m is the minimum possible distance between an active interferer and the representative receiver at the origin. From (5), we have the following as N, n, R → ∞,\nwhere the RHS equals H(x), the limit of H n (x) from (11). Substituting ρ = ρ p lim n→∞ Pr(P i > 0), taking the derivative of (14), and integrating the RHS of (12) yields (6).\nConsider HC-I model where no interferer within distance h of another interferer or the representative transmitter are allowed to transmit. Recall that as n → ∞, R → ∞, and consider two arbitrary points X 1 and X k . The probability that |X 1 − X T | < h or |X k − X T | < h decay to zero as 1 R 2 . Thus to prove the covariance criteria in the limit as n → ∞, we can focus on the case that both |X 1 −X T | > h and |X k −X T | > h.\nIf |X 1 − X k | > 2h, then P 1 > 0 if and only if there is no other interferer in B(X 1 , h), where B(X, r) is a disk of radius r centered on X. Similarly if |X 1 −X k | > 2h, P k > 0 if and only if there is no interferer in B(X k , h). Since B(X 1 , h) and B(X k , h) are disjoint for |X 1 − X k | > 2h, P 1 > 0 and P k > 0 are independent. If |X 1 − X k | > 2h, as n, R → ∞, r 1 and r K are asymptotically independent so a 1 (x) and a k (x) are asymptotically independent as well. Furthermore, if |X 1 − X k | < h, P 1 = P k = 0 and a 1 (x) = a k (x) = 0. Let\u2019s denote the event D 1 k as the event that h < |X 1 − X k | < 2h. Hence, conditioned on the complement of the event D 1 k denoted by D c 1 k , a 1 (x) and a k (x) are identically zero or asymptotically independent. Hence Cov(a 1 , a k |D c 1 k ) → 0.\nAdditionally, for notational simplicity, deﬁne the random variables e 1 = E[a 1 |D 1 k ], ¯ e 1 = E[a 1 |D c 1 k ], e k = E[a k |D 1 k ],\nand ¯ e k = E[a k |D c 1 k ], where we have written a 1 and a k to represent a 1 (x) and a K (x) for simplicity. From the law of total covariance, we have\nCov (a 1 , a k ) = Pr(D 1 k )Cov [a 1 , a k |D 1 k ] + Pr(D 1 k )e 1 e k + Pr(D c 1 k )¯ e 1 ¯ e k\n− (Pr(D 1 k )e 1 + Pr(D c 1 k )¯ e 1 ) (Pr(D 1 k )e k + Pr(D c 1 k )¯ e k ) = Pr(D 1 k )Cov [a 1 , a k |D 1 k ]\nNote that the CDF of the distance between two i.i.d. points distributed with uniform probability in a circle of radius R is of order 1 R 2 [15]. The distance between X 1 and X k clearly follows this distribution. Hence Pr(D 1 k ) = Θ 1 R 2 . There- fore, the RHS of the previous equation is of order Θ 1 R 2\nand goes to zero as n, N, R → ∞. Hence, (4) is satisﬁed. A similar argument can be made for the HC-II model."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"M.
