The problem of discovering a lattice point of shortest length is called the shortest vector problem and has applications to, for example, cryptography [1]. In general, i.e. for arbitrary lattices, the shortest vector problem is NP-hard [2, 3] 1 . However, for some lattices, the problem is easy to solve. For example, short vectors are relatively easy to determine in highly regular lattices, such as the root lattices A n and D n , their dual lattices A ∗ n and D ∗ n , and the integer lattice Z n [4, Chap. 4].\nIn this paper we consider a particular class of lattices, those of Voronoi\u2019s ﬁrst kind [5\u20137]. Each lattice of Voronoi\u2019s ﬁrst kind has what is called an obtuse superbasis. We show that if the obtuse superbasis is known, then a short vector can be computed in polynomial time by computing a minimum cut in a graph. If the lattice has dimension n, this requires O(n 3 ) operations to deterministically compute a short vector [8], or O(n 2 (log n) 3 ) operations to compute a short vector with high probability [9].\nThe paper is structured as follows. Section II deﬁnes the short vectors of a lattice along with some related entities, the Voronoi cell and the relevant vectors. Section III deﬁnes lattices of Voronoi\u2019s ﬁrst kind and shows how their short vectors can be found by solving a constrained quadratic program in binary {0, 1} variables. Section IV describes how this constrained program can be mapped into that of computing\na minimum cut in a weighted graph. Some examples are given in Section V.\nThe (open) Voronoi cell, denoted Vor(Λ), of a lattice Λ in R n is the subset of R n containing all points nearer, with respect to a given norm, the lattice point at the origin than any other lattice point. The Voronoi cell is an n-dimensional convex polytope that is symmetric about the origin. Here we will always assume the Euclidean norm (or 2-norm), so Vor(Λ) contains those points nearest in Euclidean distance to the origin.\nEquivalently the Voronoi cell can be deﬁned as the inter- section of the half spaces\nfor all v ∈ Λ\\{0}, i.e. all lattice points v ∈ Λ not equal to the origin 0. Here x · v is the inner product between vectors x and v. It is not necessary to consider all v ∈ Λ\\{0} to deﬁne the Voronoi cell. The minimal set of lattice vectors R such that Vor(Λ) = ∩ v∈R H v is called the set of Voronoi relevant vectors or simply relevant vectors [7].\nThe short (or minimal) vectors in a lattice are all those lattice points of minimum nonzero Euclidean length, i.e all those of squared length\nPlainly, every short vector is also a relevant vector, because, if a lattice point s is not relevant there exists a lattice point x not equal to s or 0 such that x · s ≥ x · x or equivalently\n· s ≥ x after dividing by x . Since both x x and s s are unit vectors and s = x then,\nAn n-dimensional lattice Λ is said to be of Voronoi\u2019s ﬁrst kind if it has what is called an obtuse superbasis [5]. That is, there exists a set of n + 1 vectors b 1 , . . . , b n+1 such that b 1 , . . . , b n are a basis for Λ,\n(the obtuse condition). The q ij are called the Selling parame- ters . It is known that all lattices in dimensions less than 4 are of Voronoi\u2019s ﬁrst kind [5]. An interesting property of lattices of Voronoi\u2019s ﬁrst kind is that their relevant vectors have a straightforward description.\nTheorem 1. (Conway and Sloane [5, Theorem 3]) The rele- vant vectors of Λ are of the form,\nwhere I is a strict subset of {1, 2, . . . , n+1} that is not empty, i.e. I ⊂ {1, 2, . . . , n + 1} and I = ∅.\nBecause each short vector is also a relevant vector we have the following corollary.\nCorollary 1. The short vectors in Λ are of the form i∈I b i where I ⊂ {1, 2, . . . , n + 1} and I = ∅.\nGiven this corollary a na¨ıve way to compute a short vector is to compute the squared length \t i∈I b i 2 for all of the 2 n+1 − 2 possible I and return a lattice point with minimum squared length. This procedure requires a number of opera- tions that grows exponentially with the dimension n. We can improve this using a minimum cut algorithm. To facilitate this consider the quadratic form\nA short vector is a minimiser of this form under the constraint that the u i ∈ {0, 1} and at least one element of u is equal to 1 and at least one element of u is equal to 0. The next section will show how this constrained quadratic minimisation problem can be solved by computing a minimum cut in a graph. This technique has appeared previously [10\u201312] but we include the derivation here so that this paper is self contained.\nLet G = {V, E} be an undirected graph with n + 1 vertices v 1 , . . . , v n+1 contained in the set V and edges e ij ∈ E connecting vertex v i to vertex v j . To each edge we assign a weight (or capacity) w ij ∈ R. The graph is undirected so the weights are symmetric, i.e. w ij = w ji . A cut in the graph G is a nonempty subset C ⊂ V of vertices with its (also nonempty)\ncomplement ¯ C ⊂ V . That is, a cut is the pair (C, ¯ C) such that both C and ¯ C are not empty, C ∩ ¯ C = ∅ and C ∪ ¯ C = V .\nwhere I = {i | v i ∈ C} and J = {j | v j ∈ ¯ C}. That is, W (C, ¯ C) is the sum of the weights on the edges crossing from the vertices in C to the vertices in ¯ C. If the graph is allowed to contain loops, i.e. edges from a vertex to itself, then the weight of these edges w ii have no effect on the weight of any cut. We may choose any values for the w ii without affecting W (C, ¯ C).\nThe minimum cut is the C and ¯ C that minimise the weight W (C, ¯ C). Let |V | = n + 1 and |E| ≤ 1 2 (n + 1)n denote the number of vertices and the number of edges in the graph G. If all of the edge weights w ij for i = j are nonnegative, a minimum cut can be computed deterministically in order\narithmetic operations using the algorithm of Stoer and Wag- ner [8] and with high probability in\noperations using the randomised algorithm of Karger and Stien [9].\nWe now show how W (C, ¯ C) can be represented as a quadratic form. Deﬁne the vector u of length n + 1 so that\nu i (1 − u j ) = 1, i ∈ C, j ∈ ¯ C 0, otherwise.\nsay. Finding a minimum cut is equivalent to ﬁnding the binary {0, 1} vector u that minimises F (u) under the constraint that at least one element in u is equal to 1 and at least one element in u is equal to 0. This constraint corresponds to the requirement that both C and ¯ C are nonempty.\nwhere k i = n+1 j=1 w ij . Observe the equivalence of F (u) and Q(u) from (2) when the weights are assigned according to,\nNote that with these weights k i = − n+2 j=0 q ij = 0 due to the superbasis condition (1).\nBecause the q ij are nonpositive for i = j the weights w ij are nonnegative for all i = j with i, j ∈ {1, n + 1}. As discussed the value of the weights w ii have no effect on the weight of any cut so setting q ii = −w ii for i ∈ {1, n + 1} is of no consequence. A vector u that minimises Q(u) can be found by computing a minimum cut in the graph with these weights. A short vector is then given as n+1 i=1 b i u i . This is our main result, so we restate it as a theorem.\nTheorem 2. Let Λ be a n-dimensional lattice of Voronoi\u2019s ﬁrst kind with obtuse superbasis b 1 , . . . , b n+1 and Selling parameters q ij = b i · b j . Let G be a graph with n + 1 vertices v 1 , . . . , v n+1 and edges e ij with weight −q ij . Let (C, ¯ C) be a minimum cut in the graph G. A short vector in the lattice Λ is given by i∈I b i where I = {i | v i ∈ C}. The squared Euclidean length of the short vector is given by the weight of the minimum cut W (C, ¯ C).\nAs examples we apply this minimum cut approach to ﬁnding a short vector in the root lattice A n and its dual lattice A ∗ n [4, pp. 108-117]. An obtuse superbasis for A n is all the cyclic shifts of the vector 1 −1 0 0 · · · 0 from R n+1 . Set the vectors,\nb 1 = 1 −1 0 0 · · · 0 b 2 = 0 1 −1 0 · · · 0\n  \n−1, i − j ≡ 1 mod n + 1 0, \t otherwise.\nThe corresponding weighted graph is the cycle graph with n + 1 vertices, each edge having weight 1. A minimum cut in this graph is to choose C to contain c consecutive vertices modulo n + 1, where 1 ≤ c ≤ n. That is, choose\nfor any integer i where the indices are considered modulo n + 1. The weight of such a cut is 2. A short vector in A n is correspondingly of the form\nwhere e i ∈ R n+1 denotes a vector of all zeros except the ith element which is equal to one. Again, the indices here are considered modulo n + 1. The squared Euclidean length of this short vector is 2. It follows that short vectors in A n are of the form e i − e j for i, j ∈ {1, . . . , n + 1}, i = j, a\nwell known fact [4, pp. 108-117]. Figure 1 displays the graph corresponding to the lattice A 3 .\nAn obtuse superbasis for the dual lattice A ∗ n is all cyclic shifts of the vector\nThe corresponding graph is the complete graph with n + 1 vertices and 1 2 (n + 1)n edges, each edge having weight 1 n+1 . As each weight is equal and the graph is complete, a minimum cut is given by placing precisely one vertex into C and the remaining vertices into ¯ C. The weight of this cut is n n+1 . All the superbasis vectors b 1 , . . . , b n+1 are short vectors of squared Euclidean length n n+1 , again a well known fact [4, pp. 108-117]. Figure 2 shows the graph corresponding to the lattice A ∗ 3 .\nIn both of the previous examples short vectors could be obtained by picking one of the vectors b 1 , . . . , b n+1 in the obtuse superbasis. This is not always the case, as our ﬁnal example will show. Consider the 3-dimensional lattice with obtuse superbasis\nb 1 = 2 −1 0 b 2 = −1 2 0 b 3 = 0 0 2\n  \n  \n  \n5 −4 \t 0 −1 −4 5 \t 0 −1\n0 \t 0 \t 4 −4 −1 −1 −4 6\n  \nFigure 3 displays the corresponding graph. The minimum cut is given by choosing C = {v 1 , v 2 } and ¯ C = {v 3 , v 4 }. This corresponds to the short vector\nof squared Euclidean length 2. Note that each of b 1 , b 2 , b 3 and b 4 have squared Euclidean length greater than 2 and are therefore not short vectors.\nWe have described a method for computing a short vector in a lattice of Voronoi\u2019s ﬁrst kind when its obtuse superbasis is known. This is achieved by mapping the shortest vector problem into that of computing a minimum cut in a weighted graph.
