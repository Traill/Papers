Recently, these constructions have been extended to asymmetric quan- tum channels in a natural way [1, 2, 6, 8, 11, 14\u201317, 22, 23, 26, 27]. Steane [24] was the ﬁrst author who introduced the notion of asymmetric quantum errors. Asymmetric quantum error-correcting codes (AQECC) are quantum codes deﬁned over quantum channels where qudit-ﬂip errors and phase- shift errors may have different probabilities. The combined amplitude damping and dephasing channel (speciﬁc to binary systems; see [22]) is an example for a quantum channel that satisﬁes d z > d x , that is, the probability of occurrence of phase-shift errors is greater than the probability of occurrence of qudit-ﬂip errors.\nLet us give a brief summary of the papers available in the literature dealing with AQECC. In [6], the authors explored the asymmetry between qubit-ﬂip and phase-shift errors to perform an optimization when compared to QECC. In [11] the authors utilize BCH codes to correct qubit-ﬂip errors and LDPC codes to correct more frequently phase-shift errors. In [26] the authors consider the investigation of AQECC via code conversion. In the papers [1, 14], families of AQECC derived from BCH codes were constructed. Asymmetric stabilizer codes derived from LDPC codes were constructed in [22], and in [23], the same authors have constructed several families of both binary and nonbinary AQECC as well as to derive bounds such as the (quantum) Singleton and the linear programming bound to AQECC. In [2], both AQECC (derived from cyclic codes) and subsystem codes were investigated. In [27], the construction of nonadditive AQECC as well as constructions of asymptotically good AQECC derived from algebraic-geometry codes were presented. In [8], the Calderbank-Shor-Steane\n(CSS) construction [4, 13, 19] was extended to include codes endowed with the Hermitian and also trace Hermitian inner product. In [7, 17], asymmetric quantum MDS codes were constructed, where in the ﬁrst paper the codes are derived from generalized Reed-Solomon codes (GRS), and in the second paper, the AQECC are non Reed-Solomon type. More recently, in [15, 16], constructions of families of AQECC by expanding GRS codes and by applying product codes, respectively, were presented.\nAs it is natural, the investigation of AQECC has received less attention when compared to QECC. Based on these facts, we show how to construct new families of AQECC by employing the quantum code expansion applied to linear classical codes by means of the CSS construction. More speciﬁcally, we construct new families of quantum generalized Reed-Muller (GRM) codes, quadratic residue (QR), character, BCH and quantum afﬁne-invariant codes by applying the CSS construction.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section II the required preliminaries are given. Section III is devoted to establish the construction of new families of AQECC. More precisely, we utilize the asymmetric quantum code expansion applied to (classical) generalized Reed-Muller (GRM) codes, quadratic residue, character codes, BCH and afﬁne-invariant codes in order to construct several new families of AQECC. Finally, in Section IV, a summary of the paper is given.\nThroughout this paper, p denotes a prime number, q denotes a prime power, F q is a ﬁnite ﬁeld with q elements, α ∈ F q m is a primitive n root of unity. As usual, [n, k, d] q denotes a (classical) linear code C over F q , of length n, dimension k and minimum distance d. We denote by wt(C) the minimum weight of C, and by d(C) the minimum distance of C. Sometimes we abuse the notation by writing C = [n, k, d] q . The parameters [[n, k, d z /d x ]] q denotes the parameters of an AQECC of length n, dimension k, where d z denotes the minimum distance corresponding to phase-shift errors and d x is the minimum distance corresponding to qudit-ﬂip errors.\nLet us give a brief description of the section. In Subsec- tion III-A we construct AQECC derived from generalized\nReed-Muller (GRM) codes. In Subsection III-B, a family of asymmetric quantum character codes is generated; Subsec- tion III-C deals with construction of AQECC derived from BCH codes, Subsection III-D presents new AQECC derived from quadratic residue (QR) codes and, in Subsection III-E, we construct new asymmetric stabilizer codes derived from afﬁne-invariant codes.\nLemma 3.1: [4, 8, 13, 19](CSS construction) Let C 1 and C 2 denote two classical linear codes with parameters [n, k 1 , d 1 ] q and [n, k 2 , d 2 ] q , respectively. Consider that\nd x = min{wt(C 1 \\C 2 ), wt(C ⊥ 2 \\C ⊥ 1 )} and d z = max{wt(C 1 \\C 2 ), wt(C ⊥ 2 \\C ⊥ 1 )}. If C 2 ⊂ C 1 , then there exists an AQECC with parameters [[n, K = k 1 − k 2 , d z /d x ]] q .\nBy applying the CSS construction we can deduce Theo- rem 3.2 and Corollary 3.3, that are useful results in order to construct new AQECC. We omit their proofs due to lack of space.\nTheorem 3.2: Let q be a prime power and m ≥ 1 be an integer. Assume there exists an AQECC with parameters [[n, k, d z /d x ]] q m , where d z ≥ d 1 and d x ≥ d 2 , derived from linear codes C 1 = [n, k 1 , d 1 ] q m and C 2 = [n, k 2 , d 2 ] q m by applying the CSS construction. Then there exists an AQECC with parameters [[mn, mk, d ∗ z /d ∗ x ]] q , where k = k 1 − k 2 , d ∗ z ≥ d 1 and d ∗ x ≥ d ⊥ 2 , where d ⊥ 2 denotes the minimum distance of the dual code C ⊥ 2 .\nCorollary 3.3: Let q be a prime power and assume that there exists an AQECC with parameters [[n, k, d z /d x ]] q m , where m ≥ 1 is an integer, d z ≥ d and d x ≥ d, derived from a (Euclidean) self-orthogonal code C = [n, k , d] q m . If q is even or q and m are odd, then there exists an AQECC with parame- ters [[mn, mk, d ∗ z /d ∗ x ]] q = [[mn, m(2k − n), d ∗ z /d ∗ x ]] q , where d ∗ z ≥ d and d ∗ x ≥ d.\nIn this subsection we present a construction of AQECC derived from generalized Reed-Muller (GRM) [12].\nThe generalized Reed-Muller (GRM) codes were introduced by Kasami, Lin, and Peterson [12]. Such class of codes was utilized by Sarvepalli and Klappenecker [20] for constructing good nonbinary stabilizer codes by means of the CSS as well as the Hermitian quantum code constructions. We utilize the notation adopted in [20]. Let us recall the deﬁnition of GRM codes:\nWe begin by considering an enumeration (P 1 , P 2 , . . . , P n ) of the points of F m q (so n = q m ). As usual, the set L m (α) denotes the vector space (considered as a subspace of F q [x 1 , . . . , x m ]) generated by polynomials of degree less than or equal to α. The GRM code R q (α, m) over F q of order α is deﬁned as\nThe q-ary GRM code R q (α, m) has parameters [q m , k(α), d(α)] q , where\nwhere m(q − 1) − α = (q − 1)u + t and 0 ≤ t < q − 1. The dual of a GRM code R q (α, m) is also a GRM code given by [R q (α, m)] ⊥ = R q (α ⊥ , m), where α ⊥ = m(q − 1) − 1 − α.\nWe use the properties of GRM codes to derive more new asymmetric quantum codes:\nTheorem 3.4: Let 0 ≤ α 1 ≤ α 2 < m(q − 1) and assume that q = p l is a prime power, where l ≥ 1. Then there exists an p-ary asymmetric quantum GRM code with parameters [[lq m , l[k(α 2 ) − k(α 1 )], d z /d x ]] p , where d z ≥ d(α 2 ), d x ≥ d(α ⊥ 1 ), k(α 2 ) and k(α 1 ) are given in Eq. (1), d(α 2 ) is given in Eq. (2) and d(α ⊥ 1 ) = (a+1)q b , where α 1 +1 = (q −1)b+a and 0 ≤ a ≤ q − 1.\nProof: First, note that since the inequality α 1 ≤ α 2 holds then the inclusion R q (α 1 , m) ⊂ R q (α 2 , m) also holds. Let β be a basis of F q over the prime ﬁeld F p and β ⊥ its dual basis. Then one can expand the codes R q (α 1 , m) and R q (α 1 , m) with respect to β obtaining, there- fore, p-ary codes β(R q (α 1 , m)) and β(R q (α 2 , m)), satis- fying β(R q (α 1 , m)) ⊂ β(R q (α 2 , m)). Expanding the dual code [R q (α 1 , m)] ⊥ with respect to β ⊥ one obtains the p-ary code [β(R q (α 1 , m))] ⊥ = β ⊥ ([R q (α 1 , m)] ⊥ ). The codes β(R q (α 1 , m)) and β(R q (α 2 , m)) have parameters [lq m , lk(α 1 ), d(α 1 )] p and [lq m , lk(α 2 ), d(α 2 )] p , respectively, where k(α 1 ) and k(α 2 ) are computed according to Eq. (1) and d(α 1 ), d(α 2 ) are computed by applying Eq. (2).\nWe know that the parameter α ⊥ 1 of the dual code [R q (α 1 , m)] ⊥ = R q (α ⊥ 1 , m) equals α ⊥ 1 = m(q − 1) − 1 − α 1 , so the minimum distance of [R q (α 1 , m)] ⊥ is equal to d(α ⊥ 1 ) = (a+1)q b , where α 1 +1 = (q −1)b+a and 0 ≤ a ≤ q −1. Thus the code [β(R q (α 1 , m))] ⊥ has minimum distance greater than or equal to d(α ⊥ 1 ).\nApplying the CSS construction to the codes β(R q (α 1 , m)), β(R q (α 2 , m)) and [β(R q (α 1 , m))] ⊥ one can get an [[lq m , l[k(α 2 ) − k(α 1 )], d z /d x ]] p asymmetric stabilizer code, where d z ≥ d(α 2 ) and d x ≥ d(α ⊥ 1 ).\nHere we construct asymmetric quantum codes derived from (classical) character codes. The class of (classical) character codes were introduced by Ding et al. [5]. These codes are deﬁned by using the characters of groups; they are linear, deﬁned over F q and are similar (with respect to the parameters) to binary Reed-Muller codes. Such class of codes was utilized by Ketkar et al. [13] to construct stabilizer codes (see Theorem 68).\nLet us recall the class of codes derived from character of a given group. For more details the reader can consult [5]. We utilize the same notation adopted in [5].\nGiven an abelian group (G, +) of order n and exponent m. Let F q be a ﬁnite ﬁeld such that gcd(n, q) = 1 and m|(q − 1). Consider the group of characters (Γ, ·) from (G, +) into (F ∗ q , ·), where the latter group is the multi- plicative group of nonzero elements of F q . Since (G, +) is isomorphic to (Γ, ·), there exists a bijection g ∈ G −→ χ g ∈ Γ. For every X ⊂ G, the character code denoted by C X is the linear code over F q deﬁned by C X =\nIf one considers the commutative group G = Z m 2 , t ≥ 1 and a ﬁnite ﬁeld F q , where q = p l and p = 2 is prime, the characters of G are given by χ a (b) = (−1) a·b , a, b ∈ G. Then one deﬁnes the code C q (r, m) = C X , where X ⊂ Z m 2 consists of elements with Hamming weight greater than r. The code C q (r, m) has parameters [2 m , s m (r), 2 m−r ] q (see [5, Theorem 6]), where\nThe (Euclidean) dual code [C q (r, m)] ⊥ of C q (r, m) is equiva- lent to C q (m−r−1, m) (see [5, Theorem 8]) and consequently has parameters [2 m , s m (m − r − 1), 2 r+1 ] q .\nIn [13] the authors constructed a family of stabilizer codes derived from character codes:\nTheorem 3.5: [13, Theorem 68] If 0 ≤ r 1 < r 2 ≤ m and q is a power of an odd prime, then there exists an [[2 m , k(r 2 ) − k(r 1 ), min{2 m−r 2 , 2 r 1 +1 }]] q quantum code,\nHere we utilize code expansion applied to character codes to generate new AQECC, as established in the following theorem:\nTheorem 3.6: If 0 ≤ r 1 < r 2 ≤ m and q = p t is a power of an odd prime p, where t ≥ 1, then there exists an [[t2 m , t(k(r 2 ) − k(r 1 )), d z /d x ]] p AQECC, where k(r) =\nProof: We know that C q (r 1 , m) ⊂ C q (r 2 , m) [13, Lemma 66] and the dual code [C q (r 1 , m)] ⊥ is equivalent to the code C q (m − r 1 − 1, m). Similarly as was done in the proofs of previous theorems, we consider β a basis of F q over F p and β ⊥ its dual basis. We expand C 1 = C q (r 1 , m) and C 2 = C q (r 2 , m) with respect to β and the code C ⊥ 1 = [C q (r 1 , m)] ⊥ with respect to β ⊥ . Applying Theorem 3.3 of Part I and the CSS construction, one can get an [[t2 m , t(k(r 2 ) − k(r 1 )), d z /d x ]] p AQECC, where t, k(r 1 ), k(r 2 ), d x and d z are speciﬁed in the hypothesis.\nIn this subsection we construct more families of asymmetric stabilizer codes derived from Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes by means of the CSS construction. The ﬁrst families of AQECC derived from BCH codes were constructed\nby Aly [1, Theorem 8]. The parameters of these codes were recently improved for some investigated families [14].\nRecall that a cyclic code of length n over F q is a BCH code with designed distance δ if, for some integer b ≥ 0, one has\nTheorem 3.7: Suppose that n = q m − 1, where q = p t is a power of an odd prime p, t ≥ 1 and m ≥ 3 are integers an integer (if q = 3, m ≥ 4). Then there exist quantum codes with parameters\n\u2022 [[tn, t(n − m(4q − c − 5) − 2), d z ≥ (2q + 2)/d x ≥ (2q − c)]] p , where 0 ≤ c ≤ q − 2;\n\u2022 [[tn, t(n − m(2c − l − 4) − 2), d z ≥ c/d x ≥ (c − l)]] p , where 2 ≤ c ≤ q and 0 ≤ l ≤ c − 2;\n\u2022 [[tn, t(n − m(2c − l − 6) − 2), d z ≥ c/d x ≥ (c − l)]] p , where q + 2 < c ≤ 2q and 0 ≤ l ≤ c − q − 3;\n\u2022 [[tn, t(n − m(4q − l − 5) − 1), d z ≥ (2q + 1)/d x ≥ (2q − l)]] p , where 0 ≤ l ≤ q − 2. Proof: Omitted by lack of space.\nTheorem 3.8: Let q = p t be a power of a prime p, t ≥ 1, gcd(q, n) = 1 and ord n (q) = m. Then there exists an AQECC with parameters [[tn, t(n − m (δ 1 − 1)(1 − 1/q) − m (δ 2 − 1)(1 − 1/q) ), d ∗ z /d ∗ x ]] p , where d ∗ z = wt(C 2 \\C ⊥ 1 ) ≥ δ 2 and d ∗ x = wt(C 1 \\C ⊥ 2 ) ≥ δ 1 .\nIn this subsection we construct families of AQECC derived from quadratic residue (QR) codes. A family of quantum codes derived from classical QR codes by means of the CSS construction was constructed in [13] (see Theorems 40 and 41).\nLet us recall the basic concepts of this class of codes. For more information we refer to [10, 18]. We follow the terminology adopted in [10].\nLet p be an odd prime. Recall that a nonzero square modulo p is a nonzero integer t such that there exists an integer x satisfying x 2 ≡ t mod p. Throughout this subsection we consider n (code length) be an odd prime not dividing q, where q is a prime power that is a square modulo n. We consider Q be the set of nonzero squares modulo n; Q is called the nonzero quadratic residues modulo n. The set N consists of non-squares modulo n and it is called quadratic non-residues modulo n.\nThe quadratic residue codes Q, Q , N and N are cyclic codes with generator polynomials q(x), (x − 1)q(x), n(x), (x − 1)n(x), respectively, where\nhave coefﬁcients from F q , and α is a primitive pth root of unity belonging to some extension ﬁeld of F q . The codes Q\nand N are the even-like subcodes of Q and N , respectively. The codes Q and N have the same parameters\nand N also have the same parameters [p, (p − 1)/2, d 2 ] q , where (d 2 ) 2 ≥ p.\nIf one examines more deeply Theorem 41 shown in [13], one can rewrite it as follows:\nTheorem 3.9: [13, Theorem 41] Let n be a prime of the form n ≡ 1 mod 4, and let q be a power of a prime that is not divisible by n. If q is a quadratic residue modulo n, then there exists an [[n, 1, d z /d x ]] q asymmetric quantum code, where d z and d x satisfy d z ≥\nHere we construct a family of AQECC derived from expan- sion of quadratic residue codes as follows:\nTheorem 3.10: Let n be a prime of the form n ≡ 1 mod 4, and let q = p t (t ≥ 1) be a power of a prime that is not divisible by n. If q is a quadratic residue modulo n, then there exists an [[tn, t, d z /d x ]] p asymmetric quantum code, where d z and d x satisfy d z ≥\nProof: Consider the codes Q, Q and N given above. Since n = 4k + 1, then it is well known that Q = N ⊥ , so N ⊥ ⊂ Q. The codes Q and N ⊥ have parameters, respectively, given by [n, (n + 1)/2, d 1 ] q , with (d 1 ) 2 ≥ n and [n, (n − 1)/2, d 2 ] q , where (d 2 ) 2 ≥ n. Consider β be a basis of F q over its prime ﬁeld F p . We expand Q and N ⊥ with respect to β, generating therefore codes β(Q) and β(N ⊥ ) with parameters [tn, t(n + 1)/2, D 1 ≥ d 1 ] p and [tn, t(n − 1)/2, D 2 ≥ d 2 ] p , respectively. Proceeding similarly as in the proof of Theorem 3.3 of Part I and applying the CSS construction to the codes β(Q), β(N ⊥ ) and [β(N ⊥ )] ⊥ , one can get an [[tn, t, d z /d x ]] p asymmetric quantum code, where d z and d x satisfy d z ≥\nTheorem 3.11: [13, Theorem 40] Let n be a prime of the form n ≡ 3 mod 4, and let q be a power of a prime that is not divisible by n. If q is a quadratic residue modulo n, then there exists an [[n, 1, d z /d x ]] q AQECC, where d z ≥ d, d x ≥ d and d satisﬁes d 2 − d + 1 ≥ n.\nWe can obtain more families of AQECC once one can guarantee the existence of self-dual basis, as the next theorem states:\nTheorem 3.12: Let n be a prime of the form n ≡ 3 mod 4, and let q = p t (t ≥ 1) be a power of a prime that is not divisible by n, where the prime p and t are odd. If q is a quadratic residue modulo n, then there exists an [[tn, t, d z /d x ]] p quantum code, where d z ≥ d, d x ≥ d and d satisﬁes d 2 − d + 1 ≥ n.\nProof: Recall that since p and t are odd, then there exists a self-dual basis β of F p t over F p . Moreover, since n = 4k − 1, the dual Q ⊥ of Q equals Q ⊥ = Q , so Q ⊥ ⊂ Q. The codes Q and Q ⊥ have parameters [n, (n + 1)/2, d] q and [n, (n − 1)/2, d ≥ d] q , respectively, where d 2 − d + 1 ≥ n.\nExpanding Q and Q ⊥ with respect to β one obtains, respec- tively, codes β(Q) and β(Q ⊥ ) = [β(Q)] ⊥ with corresponding parameters [tn, t(n + 1)/2, d 1 ≥ d] p and [tn, t(n − 1)/2, d 2 ≥ d ] p , where d 2 − d + 1 ≥ n and d ≥ d. Since [β(Q)] ⊥ ⊂ β(Q), applying the CSS construction to the self-orthogonal code β(Q) one has an [[tn, t, d z /d x ]] p code, where d z ≥ d, d x ≥ d and d 2 − d + 1 ≥ n.\nAfﬁne invariant codes [10] form an important class of codes. We brieﬂy describe this class of codes in order to give necessary preliminaries for our constructions. For more details, see [10].\nLet I be the extension ﬁeld F q t of F q (I will be the index set for the extended cyclic code of length q t that will be deﬁned below). The notation I ∗ denotes the nonzero elements of I. Assume that α is a primitive nth root of unity in I. Consider the algebra F q [I] deﬁned by\n \n \nLet C be a maximal cyclic code (that is, a cyclic code whose deﬁning set contains one cyclotomic coset) over F q of length q t − 1, and consider a codeword c = (c 0 , . . . , c n−1 ) of C with corresponding polynomial c(x) = c 0 + c 1 x + . . . + c n−1 x n−1 . We can associate the codeword c with an element C(x) ∈ F q [I ∗ ] by\n{s|0 ≤ s ≤ n}; for each s ∈ N e we deﬁne the map φ s : F q [I] −→ I by\nwhere 0 0 = 1 ∈ I. Then an extended cyclic code C e of length q t with deﬁning set T e is a code where T e ⊂ N e\nis a union of q cyclotomic cosets modulo n = q t − 1 with 0 ∈ T e and C e = {C e (x) ∈ F q [I]|φ s (C e (x)) = 0, ∀s ∈ T e }. Let PAut(C) be the permutation automorphism group of a code C and consider GA 1 (I) = {σ a,b |a ∈ I ∗ , b ∈ I}, where gσ a,b = ag + b be the afﬁne group. An afﬁne-invariant code is an extended cyclic code C e over F q such that GA 1 (I) ⊂ PAut(C e ).\nQuantum afﬁne-invariant codes were investigated in the literature [9]. Let us recall a useful result contained in that paper:\nLemma 3.13: [9, Lemma 22] Let C e be an extended max- imal afﬁne-invariant code [p m , p m − 1 − m/r, d] p r , then if p > 3 or m > 2 or r = 1, we have (C e ) ⊥ ⊂ C e .\nIf one looks more closely one can rewrite Theorem 23 shown in [9] as follows:\nTheorem 3.14: [9, Theorem 23] Let q = p r with p a prime number, m a positive integer and n = p m − 1. If p > 3 or m > 2 or r = 1 then there exists a AQECC with parameters [[p m , p m − 2 − 2 m r , d z /d x ]] q , where d z ≥ d a , d x ≥ d a , and d a is the minimum distance of an extended maximal afﬁne- invariant code.\nWe can generate more AQECC derived from afﬁne-invariant codes provided the existence of self-dual basis.\nTheorem 3.15: Let q = p r , where p is an odd prime number and r > 1 is an odd integer. Assume also that m is a positive integer and n = p m − 1. If p > 3 or m > 2 or r = 1 then there exists an AQECC com parameters [[rp m , r(p m − 2 − 2 m r ), d z /d x ]] p , where d z ≥ d a , d x ≥ d a , and d a is the minimum distance of an extended maximal afﬁne-invariant code.\nProof: Consider the self-orthogonal extended maximal afﬁne-invariant code C e with parameters [p m , p m − 1 − m/r, d] given in Lemma 3.13, where p > 3 (or m > 2 or r = 1) is an odd prime number and r > 1 is an odd integer.\nFrom hypothesis there exists a self-dual basis β of F q over F p . Expanding C e and (C e ) ⊥ with respect to β = β ⊥ and since C e is self-orthogonal, we obtain codes β(C e ) and [β(C e )] ⊥ such that [β(C e )] ⊥ ⊂ β(C e ), that is, β(C e ) is also self-orthogonal. Applying the CSS con- struction to the codes β(C e ) and [β(C e )] ⊥ one obtains an [[rp m , r(p m − 2 − 2 m r ), d z /d x ]] p AQECC, where d z ≥ d a , d x ≥ d a , and d a is the minimum distance of C e .\nWe have constructed new families of AQECC derived from classical generalized Reed-Muller code, quadratic residue, BCH codes, character and afﬁne-invariant codes by applying the CSS construction. Concerning future works, it will be interesting to investigate constructions of AQECC derived from classical algebraic-geometry codes.\nThis work was partially supported by the Brazilian Agencies CAPES and CNPq."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"S.
