Encoding for a single-user  with causal SIT was first studied by Shannon [1]. The capacity  of a general discrete memoryless channel with non-causal SIT  was characterized by Gel\u2019fand and Pinsker in [4]. Costa [5]  applied the formula obtained by Gel\u2019fand and Pinsker to the  special model of Gaussian channel with additive Gaussian  interference, and showed that the channel capacity in the  presence of interference known at the transmitter is the same as \nthe case without interference. In Costa\u2019s dirty-paper channel  (DPC), Gaussian random binning is able to eliminate the effect  of interference which is known at the transmitter, and thus  achieves capacity. Cover and Chiang [6] extended the above  results and established a general capacity Theorem for the  channel with two-sided state information. Gueguen-Sayrac [7]  derived the capacity of the DPC with partial side information  knowledge. The partial side information knowledge models the  sensing process approximating the original information. It was  shown that the capacity of the DPC with partial SI is reduced  compared to the DPC with exact or complete SI. \n In the multi-user setting, Das and Narayan [8] provided a  multi-letter characterization of the capacity region of time-\nvarying MACs with various degrees of SIT and SIR. In  [9],  a   general  framework  for  the  capacity  region of  MACs  with   causal  and  non-causal  SI  was  presented where focused  on   the  MAC  with  independent  side  information  at  the  two  transmitters. Philosof-Zamir [10],[11], extended Jafar\u2019s work \ncausally at the encoders using a random binning technique.  They also considered the Gaussian doubly dirty MAC in the  high-SNR strong interference regime [10-15].The achievable  rates using Costa\u2019s Gaussian binning vanish if both interference  signals are strong. In contrast, it is shown that lattice-strategies  (lattice pre-coding) can achieve positive rates, independent of  the interference power. Furthermore, in some cases (which  depend on the noise variance and power constraints) high  dimensional lattice strategies are in fact optimal [12].  \nIn this paper, we study the effect of partial SI knowledge in  the Gaussian doubly dirty MAC considered by Philosof-Zamir  [12]. We expect that achievable rate regions are reduced just  the same as in Costa\u2019s DPC considered by in [7]. It is readily  seen that our achievable rates include the achievable rates of  the MAC with full side information as especial cases.  \nwe state some basic terminology for lattices. Section III  includes related works. In Section IV, we state the system  model and our results based on lattice strategies for doubly  dirty MAC with partial SIT. In particular, we devote Section  IV-A to the imbalanced doubly dirty MAC with partial SIT,  and Section IV-B to the nearly balanced doubly dirty MAC  with estimated SIT.  \nWe need some basic terminology for lattices before we can  proceed and look at the modulo-lattice modulation. An   \ndimensional lattice   is defined by the generator matrix  . A point  \t  belongs to the lattice if and only if it \n where  .   is the Euclidean norm.  The modulo-lattice operation is defined by \n     Λ \t Λ .                                                               (1)  The modulo-code operation satisfies as follows \n     Λ    Λ   \t    Λ.

The second moment  per dimension of a uniform distribution over   is   \nenough , lim Λ \t , i.e., there exist good lattice  quantizers and  2 \t Λ \t  for  any  0 , \t ∞ .   When used as a channel code over an unconstrained AWGN  channel, [15], the decoding error probability is the probability  that a white Gaussian noise vector   exceeds the basic Voronoi \ncell  \t . For good AWGN channel coding, we  have  \t  for  any  0 . The Crypto lemma  [17] which states that  \t  Λ   (where   is  uniformly \ndistributed over ) is an independent random variable  uniformly distributed over  .   \nThe differential entropy of an  -dimensional random vector   which is distributed uniformly over the fundamental Voronoi \nwhere the last (approximate) equality holds for lattices that are  good for quantization. A comprehensive study of lattices and  lattice quantization can be found in [18]. \n In this section, we briefly review the Gueguen-Sayrac and  Philosof-Zamir works. \nGueguen-Sayrac work: Fig.1 shows the channel encoding  with partial observation of the side information at the encoder.  The partial observation is modeled as a compression channel  generating some distortion on the side information.     ,    ,   and \n  are random variables which represent respectively, the   source,  side  information, zero mean white Gaussian noise  ( ~ 0, ))  and the output of the ergodic channel modeled by \n.  It is supposed that   and   are  independent  and  average power limited variables  \t    and   \t .  \n is the random variable representing the partial information  obtained at the channel encoder which satisfies the following  Euclidean distortion  \t D.   \nGueguen-Sayrac Theorem [7, Theorem 2.1]: For a channel  described as above, the channel capacity between the source  and the output is expressed by  \t log 1 \t .   \nAs we see the partial side information reduces the capacity.   \nPhilosof-Zamir work: Fig.2 shows a general lattice-based  transmission scheme as the Gaussian doubly dirty MAC.  Encoder1 and encoder2 use the lattices  Λ \t Λ  and  Λ \t Λ  \n(where  ,   are real numbers), with second moments  \t   and  \t  and fundamental Voronoi regions   and ,  respectively.  \t ,  \t  are independent and  carry the information of user1 and user2. The encoders use  independent (pseudorandom) dither signals  ~ \t  and \n~ \t  where   is known to encoder1 and to the  decoder, and    is known to encoder2 and to the decoder. From  the dithered quantization property, there is  \nwhere    independent of     and  ,   0,1 . The input of  decoder is   \t  .

Most of the  definitions and assumptions we make at this work are similar to  [12], except that we have estimated SI ( ) instead of exact SIT  ( ) at the transmitters which satisfies the following Euclidean  distortion  \t  , 1,2.    \nΛ                                                (10)   \n      In the following Theorems, we provide conditions under  which lattice-strategies are optimal (Like Philosof Zamir\u2019s  work [12]). By considering two cases, imbalanced doubly  dirty MAC with estimated (partial) SIT (\n, ) and nearly doubly dirty MAC with  estimated (partial) SIT ( \t , ),  we give the achievable rate regions. \nA.  Imbalanced Doubly Dirty MAC with partial SIT  We consider the case that \n      Theorem  1:  In imbalanced case for  \t  the  achievabile rate of the doubly dirty MAC with estimation of  side information in transmitters is given by the set of all rate  pairs  ,  satisfying  \n1 \t ,                                               (11)        Corollary 1: Theorem 1 is reduced to Theorem 2 [12] by \nthe first case user1 is a helper for user2 where   , the second case user1 is a helper for \nuser2 where  \t  , the third case user2 is a  helper for user1 where  \t  , the fourth case \nuser2 is a helper for user1 where  \t . Now,  we show achievability for the first case i.e., for the point \nand  \t  , \t , the encoder1 and encoder2 send     and     , respectively, where they are generated as follows \nΛ                                                 (13)        The  output  of  the  decoder  is    \u2032\n             \t Λ                                                                   (18)  where (16) follows from (13) and (17) follows from (1), (2).
