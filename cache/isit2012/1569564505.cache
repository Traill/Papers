In this setting, there are a total of L indepen- dent discrete memoryless sources (S 1 , . . . , S L ), where the importance of the source S l is assumed to decrease with the subscript l. The sources are to be encoded by a total of L randomly accessible encoders. The goal of encoding is to ensure that the number of sources that can be nearly perfectly reconstructed grows with the number of accessible encoders. More speciﬁcally, denote by U ⊆ Ω L := {1, . . . , L} the set of accessible encoders. The realization of U is unknown a priori at the encoders. However, the sources (S 1 , . . . , S α ) need to be nearly perfectly reconstructed whenever |U | ≥ α. The word \u201csymmetrical\u201d here refers to the fact that the sources that need to be nearly perfectly reconstructed depend on the set of accessible encoders only via its cardinality. The rate allocations at different encoders, however, can be different and are not necessarily symmetrical.\nA natural strategy for SMDC is to encode the sources separately at each of the encoders (no coding across different sources) known as superposition coding [2]. To show that the natural superposition coding strategy is also optimal, however, turned out to be rather nontrivial. The optimality of superposition coding in terms of achieving the minimum sum rate was established by Roche, Yeung, and Hau [3]. The proof used a carefully constructed induction argument, for which the classical subset entropy inequality of Han [4, Ch. 17.6] played a key role. Later, the optimality of superposition coding in terms of achieving the entire admission rate region was established by Yeung and Zhang [5]. Their proof was based\non a generalization of Han\u2019s subset inequality, which was established by carefully combining Han\u2019s subset inequality with several highly technical results on the analysis of a sequence of linear programs.\nIn this paper, we consider a generalization of SMDC for which, in addition to the randomly accessible encoders, there is also an all-access encoder. More speciﬁcally, in this new setting, a total of L + 1 independent discrete memoryless sources (S 0 , S 1 , . . . , S L ) are to be encoded by a total of L + 1 encoders. While encoders 1 to L are randomly accessible encoders as before, encoder 0 is assumed to be an all-access encoder. Mathematically, if we denote by U ⊆ Ω L the set of randomly accessible encoders whose outputs are actually available at the decoder, then the set of accessible encoders at the decoder is {0} ∪ U . As before, the realization of U is unknown a priori at the encoders. However, the sources (S 0 , S 1 , . . . , S α ) need to be nearly perfectly reconstructed whenever |U | ≥ α.\nThe main result of the paper is that superposition coding remains optimal in terms of achieving the entire admissible rate region of SMDC even with the addition of an all- access encoder. Key to our proof is to identify the supporting hyperplanes that deﬁne the boundary of the admissible rate region and then builds on the result of Yeung and Zhang on the generalization of Han\u2019s subset inequality. As a special case, the (R 0 , R s ) admissible rate region, which captures all possible tradeoffs between the encoding rate R 0 of the all- access encoder and the sum encoding rate R s of the randomly accessible encoders, is explicitly characterized. To provide an explicit proof of the optimality of superposition coding, a new sliding-window subset entropy inequality is introduced and is shown to directly imply the classical subset entropy inequality of Han.\nAs illustrated in Figure 1, the problem of SMDC with an all-access encoder consists of:\n\u2022 a total of L + 1 independent discrete memoryless sources {S α [t]} ∞ t =1 , where α = 0, 1, . . . , L and t is the time index;\n\u2022 a decoder who has access to a subset {0} ∪ U of the encoder outputs, where U ⊆ Ω L .\nThe realization of U is unknown a priori at the encoders. However, no matter which U actually materializes, the decoder needs to nearly perfectly reconstruct the sources (S 0 , S 1 , . . . , S α ) whenever |U | ≥ α.\nFormally, an (n, (M 0 , M 1 , . . . , M L )) code is deﬁned by a collection of L + 1 encoding functions\n(2) A nonnegative rate tuple (R 0 , R 1 , . . . , R L ) is said to be admissible if for every > 0, there exits, for sufﬁciently large block length n, an (n, (M 0 , M 1 , . . . , M L )) code such that:\n\u2022 (Rate constraints at the encoders) 1\n(4) where S α := {S α [t]} n t =1 , X l = e l (S 0 , S 1 , . . . , S L ) is the output of encoder l, and X U := {X l : l ∈ U }.\nThe admissible rate region R is the collection of all admissible rate tuples (R 0 , R 1 , . . . , R L ).\nAs mentioned previously, a natural strategy for SMDC is superposition coding, i.e., to encode the sources separately at the encoders and there is no coding across different sources. Formally, the problem of encoding a single source S α can be viewed as a special case of the general SMDC problem where the sources S m are constants for all m = α. In this case, the source S α needs to be nearly perfectly reconstructed whenever the decoder can access at least α randomly accessible encoders in additional to the all-access encoder. Thus, the problem is essentially to transmit S α over an erasure channel, and the following simple source-channel separation scheme is known\nto be optimal (whether the all-access encoder exists or not) [1], [2]:\n\u2022 First compress the source sequence S α into a source message W using a lossless source code. It is well known [4, Ch. 5] that the rate of the source message W can be made arbitrarily close to the entropy rate H(S α ) for sufﬁciently large block length n.\n\u2022 Next, the source message W is encoded at encoders 0 to L using a maximum distance separable code [7]. It is well known [1], [2] that the source message W can be perfectly recovered at the decoder whenever\nwhere Ω (α) L is the collection of all subsets of Ω L of size α.\nWe summarize the above result into the following proposi- tion.\nProposition 1. The admissible rate region for encoding a single source S α is given by the collection of all nonnegative rate tuples (R 0 , R 1 , . . . , R L ) satisfying (5).\nBy Proposition 1, the superposition coding rate region R sup for SMDC with an all-access encoder is given by the collection of all nonnegative rate tuples (R 0 , R 1 , . . . , R L ) such that\nfor some nonnegative r (α) l , α = 0, 1, . . . , L and l = 0, 1, . . . , L, satisfying\nThe main result of the paper is that superposition coding can achieve the entire admissible rate region R of SMDC with an all-access encoder, as summarized in the following theorem.\nR = R sup . \t (8) Due to the space limitation, the readers are referred to [6]\nfor a detailed proof of the theorem. Below we summarize the main technical ingredients of the proof. First, our proof relies on the following characterization of the superposition coding rate region R sup . Let (λ 1 , . . . , λ L ) be a nonnegative vector in R L and let f α be the optimal value of the linear program\nc α (U ) subject to \t U ∈Ω (α)\nc α (U ) ≤ λ l , ∀l = 1, . . . , L c α (U ) ≥ 0, ∀U ∈ Ω (α) L\n(9) for α = 1, . . . , L. Denote by R ∗ the collection of all nonnegative rate tuples (R 0 , R 1 , . . . , R L ) satisfying\nfor all m = 1, . . . , L and all nonnegative (λ 1 , . . . , λ L ) in R L . Proposition 2.\nR sup = R ∗ . \t (12) A proof of the proposition is provided in [6]. The proof uses\nthe fact that R sup is a polyhedron with polyhedral cone being the nonnegative orthant in R L +1 and hence can be completely characterized by the supporting hyperplanes\nWe then complete the proof by showing that for any nonzero (λ 1 , . . . , λ L ), the faces of R sup are only determined by the supporting hyperplanes with λ 0 = f m for m = 1, . . . , L.\nThe second key ingredient of our proof is the following generalization of the classical subset entropy inequality of Han, which was ﬁrst established in [5, Theorem 3].\nProposition 3 (Generalized Han\u2019s subset inequality). For any nonnegative (λ 1 , . . . , λ L ) in R L , there exists a set of c α := {c α (U ) : U ∈ Ω (α) L }, α = 1, . . . , L, for which each c α is an optimal solution to the linear program (9) and such that\nc 2 (U )H(X U ) ≥ · · · ≥ U ∈Ω (L)\n(15) for any collection of L jointly distributed random variables (X 1 , . . . , X L ).\nIn [5], Proposition 3 was established via a delicate combi- nation of Han\u2019s subset inequality and several highly technical results on the analysis of the linear program (9). In [6], we provide a more structured proof which completely separates the entropy argument from the analysis of the linear program (9). The proof is based on a subset entropy inequality recently established by Madiman and Tetali [8] and an analysis result on the linear program (9) lifted from the original proof of Yeung and Zhang [5].\nThe following corollaries will be directly used in the proof of Theorem 1.\nf 1 ≥ 2f 2 ≥ · · · ≥ Lf L . \t (16) In particular,\nf 1 ≥ f 2 ≥ · · · ≥ f L . \t (17) Proof: Let c α , α = 1, . . . , L, be a set of optimal solutions\n(15) holds for any collection of L jointly distributed random variables (X 1 , . . . , X L ).

We have H(X U ) = αH(X 1 ) for all U ∈ Ω (α) L and\n(18) for all α = 1, . . . , L. Here, the second equality is due to the fact that c α is optimal so U ∈Ω (α)\nc α (U ) = f α . Substituting (18) into the inequality chain (15) and dividing each term by H(X 1 ) give the inequality chain (16).\nFor any α = 2, . . . , L, note from the inequality chain (16) that\nCorollary 2.

We have\nOur proof of the optimality of superposition coding for the entire admissible rate region relies on a characterization of the superposition coding rate region which involves solving a sequence of linear programs (9) for α = 1, . . . , L. For a general nonnegative (λ 1 , . . . , λ L ) in R L , the optimal solution of the linear program (9) cannot be written in closed-form for α = 2, . . . , L − 1. For the symmetrical situation where λ 1 = · · · = λ L , however, it is straightforward to verify that\nis an optimal solution to the linear program (9), giving the optimal value\nfor all α = 1, . . . , L. In this section, we discuss some ramiﬁcations of (22) and (23).\nA. An Explicit Characterization of the (R 0 , R s ) Admissible Rate Region\nFirst, let us use (23) to establish an explicit characterization of all possible tradeoffs between the encoding rate R 0 of the all-access encoder and the sum encoding rate R s of the randomly accessible encoders, as captured by the (R 0 , R s ) admissible rate region of the problem.\nFormally, the (R 0 , R s ) admissible rate region R is deﬁned as\n(24) where R is the admissible rate region of the problem. Let R \u2020 be the collection of all nonnegative rate pairs (R 0 , R s ) satisfying\nfor all m = 0, 1, . . . , L. We have the following explicit characterization of the (R 0 , R s ) admissible rate region R . (See Figure 2 for an illustration.)\nTheorem 2 follows Theorem 1, Proposition 2, and (23). See [6] for the details of the proof.\nBy Theorem 2, the boundary of the (R 0 , R s ) admissible rate region R is determined by the supporting hyperplanes of the admissible rate region R with λ 0 = 1 and λ 1 = · · · = λ L = m/L for m = 0, 1, . . . , L. Therefore, to prove the optimality of superposition coding for the (R 0 , R s ) admissible rate region R , one may only need to invoke the generalized Han\u2019s subset\ninequality for the special case where λ 1 = · · · = λ L > 0. Substituting (22) into the inequality chain (15) gives\n) = 1 α ( L α ) , we have\nwhich is precisely the classical subset entropy inequality of Han. We thus conclude that Han\u2019s subset inequality is sufﬁcient to prove the optimality of superposition coding for the (R 0 , R s ) admissible rate region.\nNote, however, that when λ 1 = λ 2 = · · · = λ L > 0, the optimal solution to the linear program (9) is not unique for α = 2, . . . , L − 1. Below we provide a different set of optimal solutions to the linear program (9) for α = 2, . . . , L−1, based on which we construct a new subset entropy inequality.\nWe shall start with the following notations. For any integer i, let us deﬁne\nAs illustrated in Figure 3, W (α) i represents a sliding window of length α starting with i when the integers 1, . . . , L are circularly placed (clockwise or counter clockwise) based on their natural order. Let W (α) L = {W (α) i : i ∈ Ω L } be\nthe collection of the sliding windows of length α. It is straightforward to verify that when λ 1 = λ 2 = · · · = λ L , the following solution is also optimal for the linear program (9) for α = 2, . . . , L − 1:\nSubstituting (31) into the inequality chain (15) suggests the following sliding-window subset entropy inequality, which we prove next.\nTheorem 3 (A sliding-window subset entropy inequality). For any collection of L jointly distributed random variables (X 1 , . . . , X L ), we have\n). (32)\nThe equalities hold when X 1 , . . . , X L are mutually indepen- dent of each other.\nProof: Note that it is sufﬁcient to show that for any α = 2, . . . , L,\nNext, we shall prove (33) via an induction argument and the submodularity of the entropy function.\nwhere (36) follows from the independence bound on entropy. Thus, the inequality (33) holds for α = 2.\nNext, assume that the inequality (33) holds for α = r − 1. Applying the submodularity of the entropy function\nwhere the last inequality follows from the induction assump- tion\nMoving the second term on the right-hand side of (43) to the left and multiplying both sides by 2/r proves that the inequality (33) also holds for α = r.\nFinally, note that when X 1 , . . . , X L are mutually indepen- dent, we have\n1 α\nJust like the classical subset entropy inequality of Han, the sliding-window subset entropy inequality is also sufﬁcient to prove the optimality of superposition coding for the (R 0 , R s ) admissible rate region. In fact, Han\u2019s subset inequality can be derived from the sliding-window subset entropy inequality via a very simple permutation argument.
