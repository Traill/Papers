Speciﬁcally, if a warden has an AWGN channel to the transmitter with non-zero noise power, we prove that o(\nn) bits can be sent from the transmitter to the receiver in n AWGN channel uses with probability of detection by the warden less than for any > 0, and, if a lower bound on the noise power on the warden\u2019s channel is known, then O("},"body":{"text":"bits can be covertly sent in n channel uses. Conversely, trying to transmit more than O(\nby the warden with probability one or a non-zero probability of decoding error as n → ∞. Further, we show that LPD communication on the AWGN channel allows one to send a non- zero symbol on every channel use, in contrast to what might be expected from the square root law found recently in image-based steganography."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"T.
