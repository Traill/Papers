In the classical setting of cooperation, relays help users in the transmission of their data by exploiting the broadcast nature of the wireless network. In this work, we anticipate an energy harvesting network where the nodes can share their energy as well as their information. We investigate an additional dimension of cooperation which involves the sharing of energy resources and can be described as energy cooperation .\nWe consider a simple multi-hop wireless communication system composed of a source node, a relay node and a destination node where the source and the relay nodes can harvest energy from the nature through various different sources, such as solar cells, vibration absorption devices, water mills, thermoelectric generators, etc. In particular, these nodes maintain the energy required for data transmission from the harvested energy after it is buffered in a rechargeable battery. Moreover, we assume that the source node can transfer a portion of its energy to the relay node as in Fig. 1 through a separate wireless energy transfer unit subject to an attenuation factor and a delay. We will address optimization of the energy\nmanagement policies of the source and the relay in this multi-hop communication scenario with energy harvesting and wireless energy transfer.\nOfﬂine throughput maximization for an energy harvesting transmitter has been recently analyzed by many researchers [2]\u2013[12]. In [2]\u2013[4], the problem of throughput maximization by a deadline is solved for an energy harvesting transmitter in a static channel. In [5]\u2013[10], the throughput maximization problem and its solution are extended to fading, broadcast and multiple access channels. In [11], [12], end-to-end throughput maximization problem is solved in a two-hop cooperative network where jointly optimal policy for the source and the relay turns out to be separable: The source performs single- user throughput maximization subject to its own energy arrival proﬁle without regard to the relay energy proﬁle and the relay adapts its transmission policy according to the data ﬂow coming from the source as well as its own energy arrival proﬁle. Moreover, this separable solution is not unique and thus there may be other optimal solutions that spend less energy at the source [11]. Unlike the problem in [11], [12], in our problem where energy cooperation is possible, the source is forced to be energy efﬁcient so that it can further increase the throughput by sending some of its energy to the relay.\nAnother related line of research in wireless communications with energy harvesting nodes has been presented in [13]\u2013[15]. In [13], capacity-energy function in simultaneous information and energy transfer is introduced and in [14] the tradeoff between the information rate and power transfer in a prac- tical frequency selective wireless system is investigated. In [15], the tradeoff between energy and information transfer is characterized in a MIMO broadcast system. While the energy\ntransfer in [13]\u2013[15] is based on the RF technology which may be undesirable due to its inefﬁciency, there are other methods of wireless energy transfer based on magnetic coils that are known to be more efﬁcient [16], [17].\nRelying on the possibility of efﬁcient energy transfer [16], [17], in this paper, we consider a two-hop communication net- work with energy harvesting nodes where the source assists the relay by transferring some of its energy. We extend the works in [11], [12] and formulate the end-to-end ofﬂine throughput maximization problem with wireless energy transfer subject to energy causality at both nodes and data causality at the relay node. We show that this problem is a convex optimization problem. In order to gain insight about the structure of the solution, we consider speciﬁc scenarios. If the relay energy proﬁle is higher at the beginning and lower at the end with crossing only once, we show that slot-by-slot matching the power sequences of the source and the relay is optimal. Moreover, when the energy of the source is available at the beginning, transferring energy in the ﬁrst slot is optimal. Our work reveals further relations between the problem of data transmission with an energy harvesting transmitter in [2]\u2013[4] and the problem of energy minimal data transmission in [18], [19] under delay constraints.\nWe consider a two-hop network consisting of a source node, a relay node and a destination node as shown in Fig. 1. The two queues at the source and the destination nodes are the data and energy queues. The energies that arrive at the source and the destination nodes are saved in the corresponding energy queues. The data queue of the source always carries some data packets to be delivered to the destination. The data packets sent from the source cause a depletion of the energy from the source energy queue and an increase in the relay data queue. Then, they are served out of this queue with a cost of energy depletion from the relay energy queue. We assume that the data and energy buffers are unlimited. In addition, energy expenditure is only due to data transmission; any other energy costs, e.g., processing, is not considered. There is a separate wireless energy transfer unit from the source to the relay and therefore, the source may wish to send a portion of its energy to the relay so that the relay can forward more data.\nWe assume additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) chan- nels from the source to the relay and from the relay to the destination. The received signals y r and y d at the relay and the destination, respectively, are given by y r =\ns x s + n s and y d =\nr x r + n r , where h s and h r are the fading coefﬁcients for the source-to-relay channel and the relay-to-destination channel, respectively. n s and n r are Gaussian noises each with zero-mean and unit-variance. We assume that h s = h r = 1 without loss of generality as otherwise the energy arrivals can be properly scaled. The relay operates in full-duplex mode.\nTime is slotted and there are a total of T equal length slots. Without loss of generality, we assume that the length of each slot is unity. At times t = 1, . . . , T , the source harvests energy with amounts E 1 , E 2 , . . . , E T and the relay harvests energy\nwith amounts ¯ E 1 , ¯ E 2 , . . . , ¯ E T . We assume an energy transfer efﬁciency of α, where 0 ≤ α ≤ 1. This means that when the source transfers δ i amount of energy to the relay through the wireless energy transfer unit, αδ i amount of energy enters the energy queue of the relay in the next slot. Similarly, the source uses P i power for data transmission and the data queue of the relay is increased by 1 2 log (1 + P i ) bits in the next slot. Therefore, the source and relay queues are updated with one slot delay as shown in Fig. 2. Power policy of the source is the sequence P i and δ i ; power policy of the relay is ¯ P i .\nAs the energy that has not arrived yet cannot be used for data transmission or energy transfer, the power policies of the source and the relay are constrained by the causality of energy in time. In particular, energy causality constraints are given as\nMoreover, the relay transmits data that arrives from the source. Therefore, the power policies of the source and the relay satisfy the following data causality constraints at the relay:\nThe optimal ofﬂine end-to-end throughput maximization problem with energy transfer subject to energy causality at both nodes and data causality at the relay node is:\nWe next show that the problem in (4) is a convex optimization problem. We use the change of variables from ¯ P i , P i , δ i to ¯ r i = 1 2 log 1 + ¯ P i , r i = 1 2 log (1 + P i ) , δ i . Then, the problem becomes:\nThe problem in (5) is a convex optimization problem as the objective function is concave and the feasible set is a convex set [20]. Therefore, (5) can be solved using standard techniques [20]. In particular, the Lagrangian function for the problem in (4) is:\nThe Lagrange multiplier ρ k is due to the constraint that δ k ≥ 0. Note that the same constraints apply for P i and\n¯ P i ; however, P i and ¯ P i are always nonzero in the optimal policy, therefore we exclude them. Similarly, we exclude the constraints k i =1 δ i ≤ k i =1 E i in the Lagrangian function as these constraints can never be satisﬁed with equality in the optimal policy 1 . The KKT conditions for this problem are:\nThe ﬁrst necessary optimality condition for (4) is that the source has to send as many bits as the relay can send and the relay has to ﬁnish up all the data in its data buffer. In other words, in the optimal policy, no data is left in the data queue of the relay at the end.\nProof: Suppose the stated constraint is satisﬁed with strict inequality. Then, we can increase some δ ∗ i , increase ¯ P i and decrease P i without violating the energy constraints and improve the overall throughput which contradicts the fact that ¯ P ∗ i , P ∗ i and δ ∗ i are optimal.\nWe note that if the relay energy proﬁle is sufﬁcient to forward all the bits in the optimal source data stream with respect to the source energy proﬁle, that is, if the separable policy in [11], [12] yields a policy that satisﬁes the necessary condition in Lemma 1, then it is the optimal solution for (4) and energy transfer is not needed. In fact, any energy transfer from source to relay causes a strict suboptimality in this case.\nThe second observation about the optimal policy is that the source has to exhaust the energies that have been harvested throughout the communication session either for data trans- mission or in the form of energy transfer.\nProof: Suppose this constraint is satisﬁed with strict inequality. Then, we can increase some δ ∗ i and then increase P ∗ i and ¯ P ∗ i to achieve a larger throughput and satisfy the con- straints of (4). This contradicts the optimality of P ∗ i , ¯ P ∗ i , δ ∗ i .\nAnother necessary condition satisﬁed by the optimal policy P ∗ i , ¯ P ∗ i is energy minimality. Consider the energy minimization problem subject to data causality [18], [19] where e i are energy allocated to packets and s ∈ [1 : T ] is a deadline:\nThe optimal solution for (17) is e ∗ i = P ∗ i for any s ∈ [1 : T ]. That is, the power consumption proﬁle of P ∗ i in any interval [1 : s] has to be the minimum energy consuming proﬁle that has the data proﬁle of P ∗ i in [1 : s]. The energy minimality condition is also true for ¯ P ∗ i . A corollary of the energy minimality is that if T i =1 ¯ E i < T i =1 E i , i.e., if the total relay energy is less than the total source energy, then the relay cannot forward the source data stream with its own energy. In this case, ∃i, δ ∗ i = 0, i.e., some energy transfer is needed.\nFinally, we observe that if there is a nonzero energy transfer from the source to the relay, then the relay has to exhaust all of its energy in the optimal policy.\nLemma 3 For the optimal power sequences P ∗ i , ¯ P ∗ i and energy transfer sequence δ ∗ i , if δ ∗ i = 0 for some i, then\nProof: Suppose this constraint is satisﬁed with strict inequality. Using a similar argument as in Lemma 2, we can decrease δ ∗ i and increase ¯ P ∗ i to achieve a larger throughput and satisfy the constraints of problem (4). This contradicts the optimality of P ∗ i , ¯ P ∗ i , δ ∗ i .\nNecessary conditions in Lemmas 1 through 3 do not provide detailed structural properties of the optimal policy for an algo- rithmic solution. In the next section, we consider specialized scenarios to gain insight on the jointly optimal policy.\nIn this section, we examine speciﬁc scenarios corresponding to practically interesting cases such as the cases of the source or the relay with a ﬁxed energy battery. Furthermore, they provide useful insights on how to optimally allocate power and transfer energy simultaneously.\nWe consider the scenario where the relay energy arrival proﬁle is higher at the beginning, intersects the energy arrival proﬁle of the source only once and remains lower till the end of the communication as shown in Fig. 3. In particular, we assume that there exists ˜i ∈ [0 : T ] such that i k =1 ¯ E k ≥\n∈ [1 : ˜i] and i k =1 ¯ E k ≤ i k =1 E k for all i ∈ [˜i + 1 : T ]. In Fig. 3, ˜i = 3. We note that this case also covers the setting where the relay is non energy harvesting\nand only the source harvests energy during the communication session. We propose the following solution: Form a new energy arrival proﬁle min{ i k =1 ¯ E k +αE k α +1 , i k =1 E k } as in Fig. 3 and maximize throughput with respect to this proﬁle. In particular, use i k =1 E k for i ∈ [1 : ˜i] and i k =1 ¯ E k +αE k α +1\nfor i ∈ [˜i + 1 : T ]; energy transfer is performed only at slots [˜i + 1 : T ]. The resulting power sequence is matched for the source and the relay. More speciﬁcally, we propose\n \n \n (19)\nWe next show that there exist λ i , µ i , η i , ρ i ≥ 0 that satisfy (7)- (13) and yield the solution in (19) via (14)-(16). In particular, ρ i = 0 and η i = µ i α for i ∈ [˜i + 1 : T ]. Since α T k =i η k =\nµ k for all i ∈ [˜i + 1 : T ], we have from (14) and (15) ¯ P ∗ i + αP ∗ i = 1\n− 1, which implies that λ T = 1 2 and λ i = 0 for i ∈ [˜i + 1 : T − 1]. Moreover, η i = µ i α > 0 whenever i k =1 ¯ E k +αE k α +1 is active for some i ∈ [˜i + 1 : T ]. As in [6], [7], we can show that such η i = µ i α that yield the power sequence in (19) are uniquely found for i ∈ [˜i+ 1 : T ].\nIt remains to ﬁnd the Lagrange multipliers for i ∈ [1 : ˜i]. We observe that η i = 0 and ρ i = ˜i k =i µ k for i ∈ [1 : ˜i]. That is, the relay power constraint is not active in the ﬁrst ˜i slots. This is due to the necessary energy minimality condition on P ∗ i\n¯ E k , i ∈ [1 : ˜i]. Hence, T k =i η k = T k =˜i+1 η k , i.e., constant for all i ∈ [1 : ˜i]. As ¯ P ∗ i ≤ ¯ P ∗ ˜i+1 , we specify λ i ∈ [0, 1 2 ] recursively, with λ i > 0 only when i k =1 E k constraint is active, as: λ i = 1 − ¯ P ∗ i T k =˜i+1 η k − T k =i+1 λ k .\nMoreover, µ i > 0 for slots where i k =1 E k constraint is active and µ i = T k=i λ k P ∗\n− T k =i+1 µ k . Note that the optimal source and relay power sequences are unique but there may be\nA particular case covered is when only the source has energy replenishments and the relay has all its energy initially available, i.e., ¯ E 1 > 0 and ¯ E i = 0, i > 1. If ¯ E 1 > T i =1 E i , the relay can forward all the bits sent from the source and the optimal policy is trivial. If ¯ E 1 < T i =1 E i , the optimal policy is obtained by forming a common energy proﬁle via energy transfer and matching the power and rate sequences. Another special case is when ˜i = 0, i.e., when ¯ E i < E i for all i. In\nfor all i and matching the relay and source power sequences is optimal with δ ∗ i = E i − ¯ E i +αE i α +1 . When ˜i = T , we have\n¯ E i > E i , ∀i. The source optimizes the throughput according to {E i } T i =1 and the relay power is matched with the source.\nIn this section, we consider the scenario where the source has all the available energy in the beginning (i.e., E 1 > 0 only) and the relay harvests energy throughout the communication. Let the relay energy proﬁle not be satisfactory to forward the optimal source data stream which has constant rate E 1 T . Assume δ i = 0 for some i. Since the source is not harvesting energy, the total energy of the source will then be E 1 − δ i yielding an optimal transmission power of E 1 − δ i T . Hence, the throughput of the source is independent of the slot index i the energy is transferred. However, transferring the energy at slot j < i can only increase the powers after that slot; therefore, energy transfer has to be performed as early as possible, i.e., at the ﬁrst slot. Hence, the jointly optimal policy is δ ∗ 1 = 0 and δ ∗ i = 0 for the remaining slots as shown in Fig. 4. Note that the power sequences of the source and the relay are not matched. δ ∗ 1 is found by solving a ﬁxed point equation:\nwhere f ( ¯ E 1 , ¯ E 2 , . . . , ¯ E T ) is the maximum number of bits corresponding to the energy arrival sequence ¯ E 1 , ¯ E 2 , . . . , ¯ E T .\nIn this paper, we considered a two-hop communication network with energy harvesting rechargeable nodes where the source node and the relay node are in energy as well as signal cooperation: the relay assists the source node by forwarding the data to the destination; the source assists the relay by transferring a portion of its energy to the relay. We formulated the ofﬂine end-to-end throughput maximization problem with energy transfer from the source to the relay subject to energy causality at both nodes and data causality at the relay node and we showed that it is a convex optimization problem. We studied speciﬁc cases in detail, e.g., when the relay energy proﬁle is initially higher and then lower with one crossing, as well as the case when the source energy is constant."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"A.
