For a temporally correlated fading process with band-limited Doppler spectrum in [−F, F ], with 0 ≤ F < 1 2 , it has been shown that ZF achieves a fraction 1 − 2F of the optimal degrees of freedom (DoF). On the other hand, MAT exploits delayed channel state information at transmitter (CSIT) and guarantees a constant DoF irrespectively of the fading Doppler bandwidth. In this work, we compare the net DoFs of both schemes by accounting for the correlation between fading blocks and for the resource required for downlink channel estimation. It is found that the downlink training for each receiver to learn the CSI of the others might be detrimental for the performance of MAT especially when the system size (number of users and transmit antennas) is not much smaller than the channel block length."},"body":{"text":"We consider the MISO broadcast channel with M transmit antennas and K = M receivers with a single antenna each. The observations for any channel use in block t are given by\nwhere x x x[t] is the transmit vector satisfying the average power constraint E [||x x x[t]|| 2 ] ≤ P ∀t, n k [t] ∼ N C (0, 1) is AWGN, {h h h k [t]} are M × 1 channel vectors (from the transmitter to the k-th receiver), distributed according to a temporally correlated block-fading channel process. Namely, they remain constant over a block of length T channel uses much smaller than a coherence block (see the discussion later), and change from block to block according to some stationary and ergodic process. Notice that the fading evolution can be seen as a \u201cdiscrete-time\u201d process by taking one sample per block. In fact, (1) describes the channel at any channel use of the t-th block. We omit the channel use index inside each block in order to avoid clutter of notation, since it is irrelevant for the following development. Under this setting, we consider two classes of linear strategies, zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming and the scheme proposed by Maddah-Ali and Tse [1], hereafter called \u201cMAT\u201d. On one hand, ZF can achieve the optimal degrees of freedom (DoF) of M at the price of timely and accurate channel state information at transmitter (CSIT). It is known that in order to maintain the optimal DoF the CSIT error must decrease inversely with the signal-to-noise ratio P [2]\u2013[4]. Further, in the realistic case where the fading process\nis correlated (from block to block) with band-limited Doppler spectrum in [−F, F ], 0 ≤ F < 1 2 , the ZF-achievable DoFs reduce to M (1 − 2F ) [3]. On the other hand, Maddah-Ali and Tse have shown that completely outdated CSIT is still useful [1]. In particular, the MAT scheme achieves DoFs equal to\n, if the overhead for estimating the channels at the receivers is neglected. Motivated by this exciting result, delayed CSIT has been extensively studied and its beneﬁt has been demonstrated in different multi-user network systems (see e.g. [5]). The main idea of these schemes is that the knowledge of strictly causal channel state, no matter how it is related to the current state, enables to align the interference into a space and time subspace with a reduced dimension for each receiver. A straightforward comparison between the two DoFs given above shows that there exists a cross point at which one scheme outperforms the other in the time-varying fading channels. For a ﬁxed system dimension, e.g. M = 2, we may choose ZF up to the Doppler frequency shift F < 1 6 such that 1 − 2F dominates 2 3 achieved by MAT, whereas we switch to MAT for the larger Doppler frequency shift larger than 1 6 . As the system dimension M increases, by approximating the DoF achieved by MAT as M ln M , we observe also that the cross point approaches F = 1 2 . This means that ZF becomes beneﬁcial for a wider range of the Doppler bandwidth.\nQuantifying the relative merit of ZF and MAT is the focus of this work. To this end, we shall explicitly account for: (i) temporal correlation between neighboring fading blocks, (ii) the resource overhead due to the forward training phases, (iii) the CSI error at both the transmitter and receivers and its impact on the achievable DoFs. We remark that (i) is motivated by the following scenario: in a practical OFDM-based wireless system protocol, the downlink resource blocks (tiles on the time-frequency plane) are deﬁned a priori, independently of the actual coherence bandwidth W c and coherence time T c , which depend on the scattering environment and the mobility speed of the individual users. For the case of a ﬁxed resource block length spanning T symbols, signiﬁcantly less than W c T c , the channel coefﬁcients in subsequent blocks are gener- ally correlated. For both ZF and MAT, we consider realistically that CSIR is obtained via downlink training. Because the imperfect CSIR is the basis of the feedback from users to the base-station, this naturally degrades the quality of CSIT (delayed or not). This shall be reﬂected in terms of (ii) the downlink resource loss as well as (iii) the error in CSI at\nthe transmitter and receivers. Finally, we remark that these relevant questions have been addressed in the literature [6], [7]. In particular, [6] considered a ﬁnite-rate delayed feedback to compare ZF, MAT and TDMA. Although it partially captures the temporal channel variation by the size of a block length (assumed equal to the coherence time), their model lacks these aspects. By ignoring (i) the transmitter is assumed to wait for the feedback sent by the users in each block. This incurs a signiﬁcant resource loss (delay) for ZF. Further, the feedback quantization error is the sole source of CSIT degradation while CSIR is assumed to be perfect and obtained for free (no downlink training). In contrast, we argue that downlink estimation and CSIR quality are the major sources of degradation and training overhead, while a well-designed analog or digital feedback yields no DoFs degradation, as we shown in [3]. Our numerical examples have shown that the performance of MAT degrades rather quickly for a large system dimension and for a ﬁnite block length. This is due to the need of multiuser training, where every receiver learns the delayed CSI of the other receivers. Such effects have been neglected in [6].\nThe channel vectors {h h h k [t]} deﬁne the channel state at block t. We deﬁne the state matrix S S S[t] [h h h 1 [t], . . . , h h h M [t]]. For a given block t, the M channel coefﬁcients are i.i.d. ∼ N C (0, 1) across users and base station antennas. This implies that rank(S S S[t]) = M with probability 1.\nUnder this setting, let us consider the observation over τ blocks at user k receiver, given by\nwhere y y y k = [y k [1], . . . , y k [τ ]] T , n n n k = [n k [1], . . . , n k [τ ]] T , and we let H H H k = diag({h h h H k [t]} τ t=1 ) denote the corresponding τ × τ M block-diagonal matrix. We focus on a linear precoding strategy by forming the transmit vector x x x ∈ C τ M given by\nwhere we let Q Q Q = [Q Q Q 1 , . . . , Q Q Q M ] and v v v = [v v v T 1 , . . . , v v v T M ] T . In ZF, the transmitter sends M streams block by block (τ = 1). The coded information symbols v v v k = v k (a scalar, in this case) are independent, zero-mean and have variance P M and the precoding matrices Q Q Q k have dimension M × 1 (column vectors) and are given by the columns of S S S −1 diag({a k } M k=1 ), where the coefﬁcients a k are such that Q Q Q k 2 = 1.\nIn the MAT scheme, a block transmission consists of M phases. In the j-th phase, the scheme sends (multicasts) order- j symbols, which must be decoded by j receivers, and it generates the order-(j +1) symbols. The total number of coded symbols sent to user k is M !, i.e., v v v k in (3) is an M !×1 vector. By letting τ j = M ! j denote the length of phase j, the total transmission takes τ = M j=1 τ j blocks. Thus, the number of coded information symbols per channel use achieved by the\nuse, we let T j = { j−1 i=1 τ i + 1, j−1 i=1 τ i + 2, . . . , j i=1 τ i } be the time indices corresponding to phase j. We let Q Q Q k,j , of dimension τ j M × M !, denote the precoding matrix for user k at phase j and let Q Q Q k = [Q Q Q T k,1 , . . . , Q Q Q T k,M ] T by stacking over phase j = 1, . . . , M .\nIn the MAT scheme, the matrices {Q Q Q k } are designed as follows. In phase 1, the transmitter simply sends M ! order-one symbols to each of M receivers with no CSIT, using TDMA. This yields:\nIn phase j = 2, . . . , K, the transmitter generates Q Q Q 1,j , . . . , Q Q Q K,j as a deterministic function of the CSI {S S S[t]} up to the previous j − 1 phase, i.e. t = j−1 i=1 τ i 1 . Due to the i.i.d. assumption across antennas and users for each t, there exists a precoding matrix Q Q Q simultaneously satisfying\nwhere we let Q Q Q k = [Q Q Q 1 , . . . , Q Q Q k−1 , Q Q Q k+1 , . . . , Q Q Q M ] denote the submatrix corresponding to all receivers except k.\nIn order to compare two schemes, we consider that each component of {h h h k [t]} follows a Doppler process, seen as a discrete-time process with one sample per block, as said previously. We let S h (ξ) denote the channel process power spectral density, strictly band-limited to [−F, F ] where 0 ≤ F < 1 2 denotes the maximum Doppler frequency shift, given by F = vf c T f c , with v, c, f c , and T f denoting the mobile speed [m/s], the light speed [m/s], the carrier frequency [Hz], and the block duration [sec], respectively, and satisfying the normalization 1/2 −1/2 S h (ξ)dξ = 1. In general, for both ZF and MAT, each receiver k estimates h h h k [t] based on the sequence of the observation available up to block t − d, given by\nwhere zzz k [t] ∼ N C (0, I) is AWGN and T tr , P γ denote the length and the power of the common downlink training, respectively for some training power allocation factor γ ≥ 1. In our model, we assume that the users estimate their channels based on common (i.e., multicasted to all users) downlink training symbols. User k estimates its channel vector based on (6) and obtains the MMSE estimate ˆ h h h k [t] given by\nwhere ˆ h h h k [t], ˜ h h h k [t] are independent zero-mean Gaussian with covariance (1 − d (δ))I, d (δ)I, where d (δ) for d = 1 (prediction error) and d = 0 (ﬁltering error) are obtained from\nWe recall some useful lemmas which shall be repeatedly used in the following section.\nLemma 1 (Lemma 1 [3] ): For small δ, the prediction MMSE and the ﬁltering MMSE are given respectively by\nLemma 2: For any constant diagonal matrix D D D \t 0 and any matrix A A A independent of P , we have\nlog P \t = rank(A A A). \t (12) Proofs are omitted due to space limitation.\nAs usual, by letting R ZF k (P ) denote the per-user achiev- able ergodic rate under imperfect CSIT/R with ZF, we deﬁne the DoF d ZF (M ) for the system at hand as lim P →∞ M R ZF k (P )/ log P , since the system is symmetric with respect to any user. We deﬁne d MAT (M ) in the same manner.\nThe channel estimation/feedback protocols are shown in Fig. 1. Next, we will specify different steps for each strategy.\nWe assume that, at each block t, the transmitter knows the channel state estimate ˆ S S S[t] and receiver k knows the estimate ˆ a k [t] of the useful signal coefﬁcient a k [t], to enable coherent detection. In order to acquire the CSI both at the transmitter and at the receivers, the following protocol is used:\n1) Common training: the transmitter sends pilot symbols such that all receivers estimate simultaneously their re- spective channel vectors for T tr ≥ M channel uses. Based on the observation (6), each receiver can predict the channel for the upcoming block, i.e. ˆ h h h k [t + 1].\n2) Beamformer selection: the transmitter forms the ZF beamforming vectors { ˆ Q Q Q k [t]} by using the predicted CSI ˆ S S S[t] fed back in the previous block t − 1, instead of the true channel state S S S[t].\n3) Dedicated training: in order to enable each receiver to coherently detect its useful signal, the transmitter sends sends orthogonal pilot symbols along the beamforming vectors for T ded ≥ M . The relevant observation model is a scalar version of (6) for d = 0 where we replace T tr by T ded . We have\na k [t] = ˆ a k [t] + ˜ a k [t] \t (13) where ˆ a k [t], ˜ a k [t] are independent Gaussian with zero mean and variance with 1−σ 2 ded , σ 2 ded , respectively where\n4) Feedback: Each receiver k sends its predicted channel state ˆ h h h k [t + 1] to the transmitter. Since the feedback takes place in the uplink, it does not consume the downlink resource.\n5) Data transmission: After dedicated training, the transmit- ter sends useful symbols v 1 [t], . . . , v M [t] in the remaining T − (T tr + T ded ) channel uses. The effective observation of receiver k is given by\n(14) where the ﬁrst term is useful signal, the second and third terms represent the self-interference, the multiuser interference.\nTheorem 1: Under the channel prediction and feedback protocol speciﬁed above over the temporally correlated fading process with Doppler bandwidth 0 ≤ F < 1 2 , the following DoF is achievable with ZF beamforming:\nProof: In order to minimize the overhead due to two training stages, we let T tr = T ded = M . Following [3], we have the achievable rate for any receiver k:\n(16) where the rate gap upper bound is given by\n1 M\nwhere the second, third term inside log corresponds to the self- interference, the residual multiuser interference, respectively. Since rate gap scales as 2F log P due to Lemma 1 as P → ∞, the desired DoF is obtained.\nIn order to perform the MAT algorithm, we require that the transmitter knows delayed CSI of phase j at the beginning of phase j + 1 while each receiver knows its channel at each block t. In addition to its own channel state, each user needs to know the other users\u2019 state for coherent detection. To this end, after the last phase, i.e. at block t = τ + 1, the sequence of the state matrices {S S S[t]} τ t=1 must be known to all users. We consider the following channel training/feedback procedure such that both the transmitter and receivers learn the CSI speciﬁed above.\n1) Common training: In phase j, only M − j + 1 antennas are switched on for j = 1, . . . , M . Hence, the transmitter sends pilot symbols such that all M receivers estimate M − j + 1 components of the respective channel vector. Namely, we have the size of the common training given by T tr,j ≥ M − j + 1.\n2) Precoding selection: In phase 1, the transmitter sends M symbol vectors v v v 1 , . . . , v v v M ∈ C M ! in TDMA mode according to (4). In phase j ≥ 2, the transmitter sends order-j symbols, a linear combination of the overheard signals during phase j − 1, through the precoding ma- trices ˆ Q Q Q 1,j , . . . , ˆ Q Q Q K,j , as a function of {ˆ S S S[t]} up to t = j−1 i=1 τ i [1, Section III.C].\n3) Feedback: At each block, each receiver k sends its estimated channel state ˆ h h h k [t] to the transmitter. Since the takes place in the uplink, it does not consume the downlink resource.\n4) Data transmission: at each block t = 1, . . . , τ , the transmitter sends the useful signals v v v 1 , . . . , v v v M within the remaining T − max j T tr,j = T − M channel uses.\n5) Multiuser training: After the last M -th phase, the mul- tiuser training symbols are sent. The transmitter sends M − j vectors of dimension M − j + 1 necessary for each block of phase j, irrespectively of the side information that each user might have 2 . The training length for any block of phase j is given by\nThe relevant observation model is a scalar version of (6) for d = 0 where we replace T tr by T mu,j . The aggregate length for the multiuser training is given by\nwhere we let v v v k be a vector stacking all v v v j for j = k. The ﬁrst and third terms are the useful, the aligned multiuser interference terms matched to {ˆ S S S[t]} τ t=1 , while the second,\nfourth term, denoted by η 1 , η 2 , is the self interference, the residual multiuser interference due to imperfect CSIR. Notice that ˆ H H H k ˆ Q Q Q, ˜ H H H k ˆ Q Q Q, v v v 1 , . . . , v v v M , n n n k are independent, zero-mean, Gaussian conditioned on ˆ Q Q Q.\nNotice that under this assumption we have considered only the degradation and overhead due to the downlink training, while we consider the feedback is perfect and, as for ZF, we do not take into account its dimension overhead in the DoF.\nIn order to derive an achievable rate, we provide two lemmas.\nLemma 3 (Self-interference scaling): Let ˜ h h h[t] be a M × 1 Gaussian ∼ N C (0, σ 2 I) for t = 1, . . . , τ , Q Q Q = [Q Q Q[1] T , . . . , Q Q Q[τ ] T ] T ∈ C τ M ×n be an arbitrary matrix with τ M ≥ n, v v v ∼ N C (0, P κ I n ) for some constant κ. We assume that ˜ H H H = diag {˜ h h h[t]} τ t=1 , Q Q Q, v v v are mutually independent and ||Q Q Q|| is independent of P . Deﬁning\nProof: Let ˜ h h h H j denote the j-th row of ˜ H H H. Due to the block structure of ˜ H H H, we have\n˜ h h h[t] H Q Q Q[t]Q Q Q[t] H ˜ h h h[t] t = i 0 \t t = i\nLemma 4 (Rank preservation): Under the MMSE estima- tion model in (7), we have\nProof: Due to the i.i.d. assumption across antennas and users and ˆ Q Q Q is a deterministic function of {ˆ S S S[t]} τ t=1 , the properties (5) hold true by replacing H H H k , Q Q Q with ˆ H H H k , ˆ Q Q Q.\nTheorem 2: Under the channel estimation and feedback process and the assumption speciﬁed above, the following DoF is achievable with MAT:\nProof: By letting H k = { ˆ H H H k , ˆ Q Q Q} denote the state in- formation available to receiver k. First, ignoring the overhead\ndue to the training stages, we ﬁnd the lower bound to the achievable rate of receiver k over τ blocks. We have\nQ Q k ˆ Q Q Q H k )} t + P N\nwhere (30) follows because ˆ H H H k Q Q Qv v v, η 1 + η 2 , n n n k are mutually independent Gaussian conditioned on H k for the ﬁrst term,\nv v v k , η 2 , n n n k are mutually independent Gaussian condi- tioned on H k , v v v k for the second term, (31) follows from a direct application of Lemma 3. By taking into account the overhead necessary for CSI, the achievable rate of receiver k with the CSI training and feedback is given by\nBy applying Lemma 1 and Lemma 2, it can be easily seen that\nwhere the last equality is due to Lemma 4. By putting (33), (34) together with the symmetry over receivers, we obtain the desired DoF.\nWe numerically evaluate the achievable DoF with ZF and MAT given respectively in (15) and (28). By ﬁxing the carrier frequency f c = 2 [GHz], the block duration T f = 1 [msec], we vary the block length T = T f W f by considering different block bandwidth W f , sufﬁciently smaller than the coherence bandwidth W c . In Fig. 2, we plotted the achievable DoF as a function of the block size T in channel uses for M = 4. We observe that ZF outperforms MAT up to a high speed v ≤ 140 [km/h] over the range of the block size considered here. In Fig. 3, we plotted the achievable DoF as a function of the system dimension M for a block size of T = 180. We see immediately that the overhead due to the multiuser training dominates the\nincrease of MAT scheme. Our model, which captures the temporal correlation between blocks and the cost due to the downlink training, makes the performance of MAT more pessimistic than [6]. The analysis in this work can be extended by characterizing the achievable downlink spectral efﬁciency for a given uplink resource as in [8]."},"refs":[]},"file":{"jsonClass":"File","file":"/home/arnfred/Code/trailhead/resources/isit2012/1569566149.pdf"},"links":[{"id":"1569565495","weight":50},{"id":"1569566759","weight":50},{"id":"1569566857","weight":50},{"id":"1569565611","weight":50},{"id":"1569566651","weight":50}],"meta":{"jsonClass":"HashMap$HashTrieMap","sessionid":"S13.T3.2","endtime":"15:20","authors":"Mari Kobayashi, Giuseppe Caire","date":"1341500400000","papertitle":"On the net DoF comparison between ZF and MAT over time-varying MISO broadcast channels","starttime":"15:00","session":"S13.T3: MIMO Precoding","room":"Stratton S. de P.
