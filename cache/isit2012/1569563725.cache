The two distributions are unknown; two training sequences of length N , one from each distribution, are observed. The distributions share an alphabet of size m, which is sig- niﬁcantly larger than n and N . How does N, n, m affect the probability of classiﬁcation error? We characterize the achievable error rate in a high-dimensional setting in which N, n, m all tend to inﬁnity, under the assumption that probability of any symbol is O(m −1 ). The results are:\n1) There exists an asymptotically consistent classiﬁer if and only if m = o(min{N 2 , N n}). This extends the previous consistency result in [1] to the case N = n.\n2) For the sparse sample case where max{n, N } = o(m), ﬁner results are obtained: The best achievable probability of error decays as − log(P e ) = J min{N 2 , N n}(1 + o(1))/m with J > 0.\n3) A weighted coincidence-based classiﬁer has non-zero gen- eralized error exponent J ."},"body":{"text":"Index Terms\u2014high-dimensional model, large deviations, clas- siﬁcation, sparse sample, generalized error exponent"},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"B.
